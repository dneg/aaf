About the automatically generated cvs change logs

What are they ?

The change logs are a set of automatically generated pages, each page
contains a single html table containing the changes between two tags.
For example, the page
http://aaf.sourceforge.net/build/Changes-V101-Build-0505.html
contains a log of changes made between the tags V101 and Build-0505

An index, also automatically generated, is at -
http://aaf.sourceforge.net/build/Changes-index.html

Note that changes made since the most recent tag don't appear in any
change log.

How the generation process works

The script build/history/AAFmkchangelogs generates a complete set of pages
and an index for the tags (and their dates) specified in
build/history/AAFtagdates.

How to add a new change log

The following instructions assume you are adding a new tag and want to
create a new page and an updated index.

There are 6 steps

1) apply the new tag

2) add the new tag and the corresponding date and time to AAFtagdates

3) generate a complete set of new pages and a new index

4) upload the new/changed pages and updated index to the web site

5) commit AAFtagdates

6) browse to http://aaf.sourceforge.net/build/Changes-index.html and
   admire your handiwork

Apply a the new tag

This can be done with the "cvs tag <tagname>" or "cvs rtag<tagname>"
commands. The only difference between the two is that rtag doesn't
require a working copy. Both commands work on the repository and
operate recursively (by default). So to tag all file in the repository
the easiest way is to cd to the root of a working copy. For example -

$ cd your-working-copy/AAF
$ cvs rtag Build-506
 
Add the new tag and the corresponding date and time to AAFtagdates

You can do this by noting UTC when you create the tag or by using
method given below for finding the dates/times corresponding to cvs
tags. Either way you must add the tag and its date/time to the
AAFtagdates file.

Generate a complete set of new pages and a new index

The cvs commands used by the AAFmkchangelogs script must be able to
find the cvs repository so you must set the CVSROOT environment
variable or set your current directory somewhere inside a valid cvs
working copy. The commands also operate recursively so to produce
change logs for the entire AAF tree, the easiest way is to cd to the
root of a working copy. For example -

$ cd your-working-copy/AAF
$ ./build/history/AAFmkchangelogs

Note that this step regenerates all the pages and creates an completly
new index. This may seem wasteful but is useful to ensure that the
generated pages are up to date with other changes. For example, a
change to the color map (AAFcolormap) might cause all pages to be
generated differently.

Upload the new (or changed) pages and updated index to the web site

Finding the dates/times corresponding to cvs tags

The following method is one way to find the dates/times of tags
already applied to the cvs repository. This method was used to create
the initial contents of AAFtagdates

$ cd your-working-copy/AAF
$ cvs log > Everything.log
$ cat Everything.log | awk -f build/history/flatlog.awk  > Everything.flog
$ for t in RC1 Build-0500 Build-0501 Build-0502 \
           Build-0503 Build-0504 Build-0505
> do
> grep -w $t Everything.flog | sort -r -k 3 -k 4 | \
    head -n 1 | awk '{printf("%s %s %s\n", $7, $3, $4)}'
> done
RC1 2001/04/17 22:14:43
Build-0500 2001/07/13 20:30:53
Build-0501 2001/07/29 18:58:27
Build-0502 2001/10/29 14:27:11
Build-0503 2002/02/26 17:20:24
Build-0504 2002/04/05 00:43:27
Build-0505 2002/05/29 21:23:58
$

Why are the dates/times needed, why not just use the tags ?

If you apply tag T1 at date/time D1 and tag T2 at date/time D2 the
commands "cvs log -rT1:T2" and "cvs log -rD1:D2" don't (for reasons
not fully understood by the author) produce the same (or even
equivalent) output. The output of "cvs log -rD1:D2" is the output we
need in this case.

How do I get a log of all the changes that have been made since the
most recent tag in AAFtagdates ?
