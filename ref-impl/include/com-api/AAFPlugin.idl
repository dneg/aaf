/// The IAAFEssenceStream interface is an internal interface used by AAFEssenceAccess and
/// essence codecs to read the low-level representation of the essence.  There are multiple
/// classes implementing this interface, each representing a different underlying container
/// holding the essence data.  The idea of "container" is separate from any formatting such
/// as WAVE or JPEG.  Examples of containers (and therefore streams), are essence embedded
/// in AAF files, and essence in a file all by itself (ex. a WAVE file).
///
/// Objects which support this interface must be created by methods in IAAFContainerDef, since
/// the container definition is what is used to differentiate between the different streams.
/// If the stream needs a reference to data other than a file pointer (ex. the AAFContainer
/// makes a stream which needs a reference to a structureed storage stream) will have another
/// interface to support the additional behaviour.  For an AAF container, the additional interface
/// is IAAFEssenceDataStream.
///
/// NOTE: The SDK will init the representation of this object with the correct path
/// and open the underlying file before handing out an interface pointer.  Hence,
/// there is no Open method on the stream.
