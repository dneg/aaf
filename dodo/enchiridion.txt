1) Running dodo on Windows

  a) Using Cygwin and GNU make

     This is the preferred method for running dodo on Windows.

  b) Using the MKS Korn shell and GNU make

     This is the method for running dodo on Windows that was in place
     when AAF transitioned to OpenSource.

  c) Using the MKS Korn shell and clearmake

     This was the method originally used to run dodo at Avid but since
     clearmake is not freely available (it is part of Rational
     ClearCase) we switched to method b) above when AAF transitioned
     to OpenSource.

     $ clearmake -C gnu -f makefile SHELL=y:/mksnt/sh.exe

     + "-C gnu" tells clearmake to run in GNU make compatibility mode
         (compatibility is limited)

     + "-f makefile" is necessary because of the presence of
         GNUmakefile, added when b) was implemented, clearmake can't
         process GNUmakefile even in GNU compatibility mode.
 
     + "SHELL=y:/mksnt/sh.exe" is necessary because I have the MKS
          tools installed on Y: and not C:

2) Running dodo on Unix/Linux

  Run GNU make on GNUmakefile in the dodo directory as follows -

     $ cd dodo
     $ make

  Note
   - "make --just-print" (same as "make -n") doesn't work because the
     recursive makefiles don't pass on MAKEFLAGS properly.

3) Running dodo from MPW on Macintosh

    # Where you put "cvs checkout AAF"
  set -e aaf "MacintoshHD:TimsFolder:sf:AAF:"
  set -e MacDodo "{aaf}AAFMacSDK:dodo:"
  set Commands "{Commands},{MacDodo}Tool:"

    # Where you installed MacPerl
  set -e MACPERL 'MacintoshHD:Applications (Mac OS 9):MPW 3.6d7:MacPerl:'

  directory {MacDodo}
  make cleansdk > make.out
  make.out

  rundodo

4) Notes

  Before running dodo on Macintosh consider temporarily commenting out
  the line that says
    SetFile -m . "{DSTFILE}"
  in your working copy of the file
    :AAFMacSDK:dodo:tool:copy_if_diff
  this will, depending on your CVS client (currently true for MAC CVS
  Pro) , make files whose contents have not changed, appear as locally
  modified.

  This is also true on Windows of WinCVS, in that case consider
  temporarily modifying the line that says
    touch $2
  in your working copy of the file
    update.ksh
