/// 
/// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
///   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the

///
/// AAFRESULT_NOT_INITIALIZED
///   - This object has not yet had Initialize\(\) called on it through

///     appropriate for the Initialize\(\) method to exist in this
///     interface.  The Initialize\(\) method is available through the
