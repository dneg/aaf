AD_IDL(//
// This interface is used with an object representing an AAF file.
// An object supporting IAAFFile may be in one of the following
// states:
//
// 1\) Open for Reading with AAFFileOpenExistingRead.  This file 
//    object is associated with a filesystem file from which information
//    is only to be read.
//
// 2\) Open for Modification with AAFFileOpenExistingModify or 
//    AAFFileOpenNewModify.  This file object is associated with a
//    filesystem file\, potentially containing data which is to be
//    modified.
//
// 3\) Open as a Transient File with AAFFileOpenTransient.  This file 
//    object is not associated with any filesystem file\, but it may 
//    still be used to contain AAF objects.
//
// 4\) Closed.  This file object is neither transient nor is it
//    associated with any filesystem entities.
//
// When created and Initialize\(\)d\, objects implementing this interface
// are initially in the Closed state.
//
// In general an IAAFFile-implementing object may not be transitioned
// directly from one Open state to another; it must first be put
// through the Closed state.  The exception is a Transient file\, which
// may be transitioned directly from Transient to Open for
// Modification via the SaveAs\(\) method.
//
// Any filesystem file can be opened for reading by multiple
// IAAFFile-supporting objects.
//
// It is not recommended to Close an IAAFFile-implementing object
// which contains objects to which outstanding references are held in
// client code.  Nevertheless\, even if that is done\, the Close\(\)
// method will succeed and all referenced objects will be put into a
// Detached state in which may cause any methods on such objects to
// fail with the error status of AAFRESULT_NOT_IN_FILE.
//
// The Revert feature allows any unsaved changes to be discarded. The
// state of this object and all contained objects will return to that
// when it was last saved or opened\, whichever is most recent.  Note
// that Revert will only succeed if this object was opened as
// Revertable.  If it was not opened as Revertable\, then the
// implementation reserves the right to optimize memory usage by
// potentially writing the state of "dirty" objects to the file
// automatically at any time.  The disadvantage of using Revertable
// mode is that all unsaved changes must be kept in memory and cannot
// be dumped to disk until explicitly commanded.  Note that transient
// files are never considered Revertable.
//
// Note also that changes to essence\, even on a file marked
// Revertable\, must be committed to disk and cannot be reverted.
//
// In addition to the specific error results listed for each method\,
// all methods in this interface may also return one of the following
// values:
// 
// AAFRESULT_NOMEMORY
//   - insufficient system memory is available to perform the
//     operation.
