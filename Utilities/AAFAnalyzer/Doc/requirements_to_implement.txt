track, the SourceReference::ChannelIDs property shall be used with multiple
elements in the array.

REQ_EP_116
When exporting multi-channel essence as a single file SourceMob where the 
multi-channel essence requires a codec that is not widely avaliable, the
exporting application should also export the individual channels as separate
essence and file SourceMobs, linked into the Mob reference chain.

A clip with multiple file source choices shall be specified using an 
EssenceGroup object in a MasterMob.

An AAF Mob (such as an AAF composition) may reference an auxiliary SourceMob 
using a SourceReference (or sub-class thereof) from a DataDef_Auxiliary Slot in
the referencing Mob to the DataDef_Auxiliary Slot in the auxiliary SourceMob.
9.1.1

REQ_EP_148
The Data Definition for non-essence tracks containing annotations shall be 
DataDef_DescriptiveMetadata.

REQ_EP_156
Importing applications should be aware that legacy files might contain 
CommentMarkers in tracks with unexpected DataDefinitions such as
DataDef_LegacyPicture or DataDef_LegacySound or others.  The importing
application may freely convert such DataDefinitions to
DataDef_DescriptiveMetadata.
10.1.1
> This is a MAY requirement.

REQ_EP_163
The effects defined in the Edit Protocol should be used with the AAF v1.1 data 
definition values of DataDef_Picture and DataDef_Sound.  The deprecated data
definition values of DataDef_LegacyPicture and DataDef_LegacySound should only
be used when working with legacy AAF v1.0 files.

Multiple effects sharing common material shall be constructed within a 
NestedScope object.  A continuous section of common material, used by several

Effects that take multiple video inputs shall have all of their parameters VH

effect definition.

REQ_EP_191
The Edit Protocol deprecates the use of specifying a Video Repeat Effect by 
using a SourceClip in a TimelineMobSlot that references a still frame in a
StaticMobSlot.  An exporting application shall not use this representation and
an importing application need not accept it.
12.4.1
> OK: if this means that a video source clip in a timeline mob slot can not
> reference a StaticMobSlot.

REQ_EP_238
A Mono Audio Pan effect shall only be applied to audio tracks that refer to mono
essence.
