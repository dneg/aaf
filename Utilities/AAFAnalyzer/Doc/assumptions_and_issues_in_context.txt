Issues:
33. Essence track is not defined.  It is assumed to 	be a MobSlot that has a
	Sound or Picture DataDefinition.
	
	42. REQ_EP_099 and REQ_EP_100 state that the edit rates of audio tracks must
	equal the sample rate and the edit rates of video tracks must be less than
	or equal to the sample rate respectively.  Currently, it is assumed that an
	audio track is a mob slot where IsSoundKind() is true that contains a
	File Source mob	and a video track is a mob slot where IsPictureKind() is
	true that contains a File Source mob.  This includes StaticMobSlots, which
	do not have edit rates.  Until more information is avaliable, all 
	StaticMobSlots will cause test failures.
	
48. Effects are being classified solely based upon their AUIDs, not the rest
	of their definition.  There should be a requirement that can be tested that
	states the AUID can only be used for effects matching the definitions
	specified in section 12.

Issues:
 1. The Edit Protocol does not specify what type of references a file source is
    allowed to reference.  REQ_EP_063 states that "if a file source has any of
    the following sources, then those source mobs should be referenced and
    included by the file source."  This is an application requirement that and
    is a "should" not a "shall."  Until a more appropriate requirement is
    available, REQ_EP_063 is being used to specify an invalid reference from
    a file source.
 
 2. REQ_EP_063 only deals with references to import, tape and film sources, not
    file sources.  This was discussed in the conference call on September 26
    and it was concluded that this was probably an omission.  With (1),
    REQ_EP_063 is being used to specify that a reference from a file source to
    another file source is valid.
    
 3. REQ_EP_064 states "if a file source does not have one of the above sources,
    then it shall reference and include a recording source."  This is currently
    being interpreted to mean that a file source must reference another source
    (it can not be the end of the derivation chain).  The requirement is not
    being interpreted as an if and only if, therefore, a file source may have
    a(n) file/import/tape/file source as well as a recording source.
    
 4. The Edit Protocol does not specify what types of references an import
    source is allowed to reference.  REQ_EP_076 states that "if an import
    source has any of the following sources, then those source mobs should be
    included and referenced by the import source."  This is an application
    requirement and is a "should" not a "shall."  Until a more appropriate
    requirement is available, REQ_EP_076 is being used to specify an invalid
    reference from an import source.
    
 5. The Edit Protocol does not specify what type of references a tape source is
    allowed to reference.  REQ_EP_083 states that "if a tape source has a film
    source, then it should be included and referenced by the tape source.  This
    is an application requirement and is a "should" not a "shall."  Until a
    more appropriate requirement is available, REQ_EP_083 is being used to
    specify an invalid reference from a tape source.
    
 6. The Edit Protocol does not specify what type of references a film source is
    allowed to reference.  Currently, a test will fail, although all
    requirements will appear to have passed if a film source is not the end of
    the derivation chain.
    
 7. Currently a test will fail if a CompositionMob does not have a UsageCode
    property.  However, there is no requirement in the Edit Protocol that
    specifies that every CompositionMob must have a UsageCode property.
    Currently, the test will fail and all requirements will appear to pass,
    A possible solution is to fail the requirement that specifies acceptable
    references out of the "current node."
    
 8. Currently a test will fail if a CompositionMob or a MasterMob has an
    unknown UsageCode property.  However, there is no requirement in the Edit
    Protocol that specifies a UsageCode property must be one that currently
    exists.  Currently, the test will fail and all requirements will appear to
    pass.  A possible solution is to fail the requirement that specifies
    acceptable references out of the "current node."
    
 9. Currently a test will fail if a SourceMob has no descriptor.  However, the
    Edit Protocol does not specify that a SourceMob must have a descriptor.
    Currently, the test will fail and all requirements will appear to pass.  A
    possible solution is to fail the requirement that specifies acceptable
    references out of the "current node."
    
10. Currently a test will fail if a SourceMob has an "invalid" descriptor (ie.
    Auxiliary).  However, the Edit Protocol does not specify that a SourceMob
    cannot have an "invalid" descriptor.  Currently, the test will fail and all
    requirements will appear to pass.  A possible solution is to fail the
    requirement that specifies acceptable references out of the "current node."
    
11. Currently a test will fail if a SourceClip does not have a SourceReference
    property.  However, the Edit Protocol does not specify that a SourceClip
    must have a SourceReference property.  Currently, the test will fail and
    all requirements will appear to pass.  A possible solution is to fail the
    requirement that specifies acceptable references out of the "current node."
    
12. Tests will currently fail if the first "node" in the derivation chain is
    anything other than a top-level composition.  REQ_EP_030 states that "a
    lower-level composition shall be referenced by a top-level or lower-level
    in the AAF file," but there are no similar requirements that specify other
    types of "nodes" cannot be the initial "node" (the exception is REQ_EP_025
    which specifies top-level composition shall not be referenced).  Also, due
    to the way the CompMobDependency is implemented, only CompositionMobs
    will be considered as the first "node" in a derivation chain.  Unreferenced
    SourceMobs, MasterMobs and SourceClips will never be tested.
    
13. REQ_EP_026, REQ_EP_031, REQ_EP_036 and REQ_EP_045 state that top-level,
    lower-level, sub-clip and adjusted-clip compositions respectively "shall
    only reference the following kinds of material."  When the derivation chain
    ends no material is referenced, therefore these requirements do not prevent
    these compositions from being the end of the chain.  Currently, if one of
    these compositions is the end of a chain, the test will fail, however, all
    requirements will appear to pass.
    
14. As was discussed in the conference call on September 26, 2005, REQ_EP_031
    does not specify a lower-level composition can reference another
    lower-level composition although REQ_EP_030 implies that this is a valid
    reference.  As was decided during the call, this was probably an omission
    therefore, REQ_EP_031 is used to specify a valid reference from one
    lower-level composition to another.
    
15. As was discussed during the conference call on September 26, 2005, the
    figure in Section 6.1 makes it appear that a Clip may be the end of the
    derivation chain.  Until further information is avaliable, the test will
    assume that it is valid for a clip to be the end of the derivation chain.
    
29. The legal layout of a derivation chain is not specified in test, only in
    the diagram.

43. The term zero-valued SourceClip object is not defined.  For the purpose of
	this test, it is assumed to be a SourceClip object with a SourceID = 
	{ {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, 0, 0, 0, 0, { 0, 0, 0, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0} } } =
	00000000000000000000000000000000-00000000-0000-0000-0000000000000000.
	
44. The term essence track is not defined.  For the purpose of this test
	(REQ_EP_050, REQ_EP_072), it is aussumed to be any SourceClip object along
	the derivation chain.  If this is correct, the term should be changed as
	it conflicts with the definition of Essence Track used throughout other
	tests.
	
47. There is no requirement that specifies when it is legal to end the
	derivation chain.  Currently, an illegal end of the derivation chain is
	detected based upon the diagram in section 6.1.  A failure will be reported,
	but, not requirements will be shown as failing.
	
58. Auxiliary SourceMobs are defined in section 9.1.1 and requirements specify
	what data they can include.  However, they do not fit anywhere in the
	derivation chain.  This may be correct, but, if it is not, the derivation
	test will fail when an Auxiliary SourceMob is encountered in the derivation
	chain.

Test Name:
	EPNameTest
Description:
	Visit all mobs and ensure that they are correctly named and also that the
	MobSlots contained within are properly named.
Requirements Tested:

Warn Conditions:
	NONE
Fail Conditions:
	REQ_EP_027 - Fail if the mob does not have a valid name.
	REQ_EP_027 - Fail if the mob has the same name as any other composition mob.
	REQ_EP_032 - Fail if the mob does not have a valid name.
	REQ_EP_032 - Fail if the mob has the same name as any other composition mob.
	REQ_EP_038 - Fail if the mob does not have a valid name.
	REQ_EP_047 - Fail if the mob does not have a valid name.
	REQ_EP_052 - Fail if the mob does not have a valid name.
	REQ_EP_057 - Fail if the mob does not have a valid name.

	REQ_EP_086 - Fail if the mob does not have a valid name.
	REQ_EP_101 - Fail if the MobSlot does not have a valid name.
	REQ_EP_101 - Fail if any two essence tracks have the same name.
	REQ_EP_161 - Fail if any DefinitionObject in the dictionary does not have
				 a valid name.
Issues:
41. The words "valid name" are used throughout the Edit Protocol, but what makes
	a name valid is never determined.  Until further information is avaliable,
	it is assumed that a name is valid if an AAF Object has a name property that
	has been set.
	
46. REQ_EP_161 can not easily be regression tested as there does not appear to
	be any way to add a DefinitionObject to the dictionary without first calling
	its initialize method.  The initialize method will provide the
	DefinitionObject with a valid name.

Test Name:
	EPContainedTrackTest
Description:
	Make sure that mobs contain all the tracks that they must contain.
Requirements Tested:
	REQ_EP_028 (6.3)
		A top-level composition shall contain one or more timecode tracks and

		Protocol.
	REQ_EP_131 (7.11)
		A Primary timecode track (see Section 6.3 of the AAF Edit Protocol) in a 
		top-level or lower-level composition shall consist of a single Timecode
		object.
	REQ_EP_136 (9.1.1)
		An auxiliary SourceMob shall contain at least one Slot, which may be a

Issues:
19. REQ_EP_028 does not specify if physical track numbers may be repeated. 
    Until further information is avaliable, it is assumed that they can not be
    repeated.
	
20. REQ_EP_028 does not specify if reserved physical track numbers are legal
    values.  Until further information is avaliable, it is assumed that they are
    illegal.
	
21. REQ_EP_028 does not specify if physical track numbers outside the range 1-6
    are legal.  Until further information is avaliable, it is assumed that they
    are illegal.
	
22. REQ_EP_082 does not specify if physical track numbers may be repeated. 
    Until further information is avaliable, it is assumed that they can not be
    repeated.
	
23. REQ_EP_082 does not specify if reserved physical track numbers are legal
    values.  Until further information is avaliable, it is assumed that they are
    illegal.
	
24. REQ_EP_082 does not specify if physical track numbers outside the range 1-12
    are legal.  Until further information is avaliable, it is assumed that they
    are illegal.
	
25. REQ_EP_087 does not specify if physical track numbers may be repeated. 
    Until further information is avaliable, it is assumed that they can not be
    repeated.
	
26. REQ_EP_087 does not specify if physical track numbers outside the range 1-3
    are legal.  Until further information is avaliable, it is assumed that they
    are illegal.
    
27. Timecode track is not defined.  It is assumed to be a MobSlot where
	IsTimecodeType is true.
    
28. Edgecode track is not defined.  It is assumed to be a MobSlot where
    IsEdgecodeType is true.

30. REQ_EP_037 states each essence track of a sub-clip composition shall contain
    exactly one SourceClip - what about sequences of one SourceClip? Currently, 
    sequences are not accepted.
	
31. REQ_EP_046 states each essence track of an adjusted-clip composition shall
    contain exactly one OperationGroup - what about sequence of one
	OperationGroup?  Currently sequences are not accepted.
	
55. It is assumed that REQ_EP_131 means that a Primary Timecode mob slot can only
	have one Timecode object (ie. No sequences and it can not be the child of
	another segment).
	
56. REQ_EP_131 refers to Primary Timecode Tracks in Lower-Level compositions.
    Primary Timecode Tracks are only defined for Top-Level Compositions and Tape
    Sources.  It is assumed that the definition is consistent.
    
57. REQ_EP_136 says the slots in an Auxiliary SourceMob may be timeline, event
    or static.  May implies that this is optional, so any time of slot is legal.
    If this is not correct, the requirement should be written with a shall in
    place of the may.

Test Name:
	EPTrackContentsTest
Description:
	Visit mobs and ensure that the tracks within have valid contents.
Requirements Tested:
	REQ_EP_103 (7.6)
		The MobSlot::PhysicalTrackNumber property shall be specified for essence
		MobSlots within the following kinds of Mobs: CompositionMob, MasterMob,
		recording SourceMob, import SourceMob, tape SourceMob, film SourceMob.
	REQ_EP_108 (7.7)
		The marked IN and OUT points and user position shall be specified using
		the TimelineMobSlot::MarkIn, TimelineMobSlot::MarkOut and

Fail Conditions:
	REQ_EP_103 - Fail if the mob has an essence track without a
				 PhysicalTrackNumber property specified.
Issues:
76. There is not much to be tested for REQ_EP_108.  Currently it is being used
	to ensure either both or neither of the TimelineMobSlot::MarkIn and
	TimelineMobSlot::MarkOut properties are present and that the MarkOut point
	does not occur before the MarkIn point.

Test Name:
	EPLocatorTest
Description:
	Visit File and Import Sources and ensure that they contain valid locators.
Requirements Tested:
	REQ_EP_059 (6.9)
		The essence associated with a file SourceMob shall either be internal to
		the AAF file in an EssenceData object or external to the AAF file.  In

		essence container.
	REQ_EP_060 (6.9)
		Where essence is external to the AAF file, the

		NetworkLocator that complies with the constrains set out in Section 6.9
		of the AAF Edit Protocol.
	REQ_EP_075 (6.11)
		The EssenceDescriptor::Locator property shall include at least one

	REQ_EP_060 - Present a warning if the no file referenced by a locator can
				 be found.
	REQ_EP_061 - Present a warning if none of the NetworkLocators comply with
		 		 the constraints set out in Section 6.9.
Fail Conditions:
	REQ_EP_059 - Fail if the ContainerFormat of any file descriptor is
				 something other than kAAFContainerDef_External or
				 kAAFContainerDef_AAF.
	REQ_EP_075 - Fail if none of the NetworkLocators comply with the constrains
				 set out in Section 6.9.
Issues:
35. REQ_EP_061 and REQ_EP_075 require that URIs comply with RFC 2396 and also
	that absolute URIs conform to RFC 1738.  However, RFC 2396 updates RFC 1738.
	If a URI complies with RFC 2396, but one of the updates cause it to not
	conform with RFC 1738 should the test fail?  What if in order to comform to
	RFC 1738 it can not comply with RFC 2396.
	
36. REQ_EP_061 and REQ_EP_075 require that if a NetworkLocator contains a
	"relative URI, the base URI should be determined from the URI of the AAF
	file itself."  What exactly does this mean?
	
37. REQ_EP_059 says that essence associated with a file SourceMob shall be
    internal to the AAF file or external to the AAF file.  If the 
    FileDescriptor::ContainerDefinition property is used to determine if the
    essence is internal or external, what values indicate internal and what
    values indicate external.  Are there some values that are illegal?  For now
    assume the only legal values are kAAFContainerDef_External and
    kAAFContainerDef_AAF.
    
38. REQ_EP_060 states there should be a Locator specifying the location of the
    essence.  REQ_EP_061 states there should be a NetworkLocator that complies
    with a set of constraints.  These requirements do not state that these must
    be the same locator.  There are enough differences in these requirements
    (60: Locator, 61: NetworkLocator; 60: External to the AAF File; 61: Internal
    or External is not specified), that the test is currently being implemented
    to accept two differnt locators that will meet these requeirements.
    
39. The URI validator that is currently being used does not accept wide
	characters.  It also does not appear to accept relative URIs.  Until
	a different URI validator is found, these problems will exist when
	validating URIs.
	
40. REQ_EP_060 tests if a file exists at the location pointed to by the locator.
    Currently this is done assuming the path is specified as an absolute URI.
    Once a URI tool that deals with relative URIs, this can be modified to
    to allow the path to be absolute or relative.

45. How do you acuratley check that a file exists (ie. it is insufficient to
    check if the file can be open using an ifstream) in a platform independant
    fashion?
    
50. The URI validator currently being used is libURI
	(http://sourceforge.net/projects/liburi/) is not sufficient for this test.
	Until a better validator is avaliable, this test will be registered but not
	run.

Description:
	Make sure that all tracks have valid contents.
Requirements Tested:
	REQ_EP_091 (7.1)
		The edit rate value shall be equivalent to the values in the table in

	REQ_EP_099 (7.3)
		All audio tracks within a file shall have the same edit rate and sample
		rate.
	REQ_EP_100 (7.4)
		The video edit rate shall be less than or equal to the video sample

Warn Conditions:
	NONE
Fail Conditions:
	REQ_EP_091 - Fail if the edit rate of an essence track is not equivalent to
				 a value in the	table in Section 7.1.
	REQ_EP_091 - Fail if an essence track is a static or unknown type of
				 MobSlot.
	REQ_EP_092 - Fail if the edit rate of an essence track has a numerator or
				 denominator that is less than or equal to zero.
	REQ_EP_099 - Fail if all audio tracks in the AAF file do not have the same
				 edit rate.  Also fail if this edit rate is not equivalent to
				 the sample rate of all audio tracks in the file.
	REQ_EP_099 - Fail if a audio track is a static or unknown type of MobSlot.
	REQ_EP_100 - Fail if a video track has an edit rate that is less greater
				 than its sample rate.
	REQ_EP_100 - Fail if a video track is a static or unknown type of MobSlot.
Issues:   
34. REQ_EP_091 states that the edit rate of an essence track must be equivalent
    to value in the table.  However, StaticMobSlots do not have edit rates.
    As was noted above, it is assumed that an essence track is a MobSlot with
    a Sound or Picture DataDefinition.  How should REQ_EP_091 treat 
    StaticMobSlots?

	REQ_EP_249 - Fail if there is no outgoing segment.
Issues:
49. Section 12 uses the phrases "within a Transition object" and "not within
	"a transition object".  This is not clear.  Currently it is assumed to mean
	that the direct parent must or must not be a Transition object, however, it
	is ok if an ancestor higher than a parent is a Transition object.

51. REQ_EP_187 does not specify if the Speed Ratio parameter should be constant
	or varying value.  Currently it is assumed that it must be constant in order
	for there to be a ratio value of zero.  Tests will fail if it is not
	constant.
	
52. It is assumed that REQ_EP_187 applies only to Speed Ratio Parameters that
	belong to Video Speed Control effects.
	
53. There is no easy way to regression test Speed Ratio parameters for
	REQ_EP_187.
	
64. When testing REQ_EP_248 and REQ_EP_249 it is assumed that the parent of a
	transition must be a sequence.  Under the current AAF Object specification,
	this appears to be a valid assumption, however, should the specification
	change, the requirements may need to change.

65. When REQ_EP_248 and REQ_EP_249 state that segments must be specified from
	the begining/to the end of a Transition, it is assumed that this means the
	length of the segment must be at least as long as the transition.

66. REQ_EP_248 and REQ_EP_249 cannot be accuratley regression tested as the
    implementation of the AAF object model does not allow the following failure
    cases of these requirements:
    	a) Incoming or Outgoing Segments that are too short.
    	b) Transitions or Segments with no length.
    	c) A Transition with no outgoing segment.

67. The conditions tested by REQ_EP_248 are a subset of the conditions tested by
	REQ_EP_249.  REQ_EP_248 is not necessary since when it fails, an identical
	failure of REQ_EP_249 will be produced.

68. REQ_EP_248 and REQ_EP_249 are requirements for Two-Parameter Mono Audio
	Dissolve effects.  There should probably be an analogous requirement for
	Single Parameter Mono Audio Dissolve effects.
	
Test Name:
	EPAnnotationTest
Description:
	Make sure that annotations in an AAF file are legal.
Requirements Tested:
	REQ_EP_147 (10.1)
		Component::UserComments shall only be used on: the Segment of a MobSlot
		or a CommentMarker (or its subclasses).
	REQ_EP_149 (10.1)
		CommentMarkers may be used for annotations that are not associated with
		a specific essence track; otherwise DescriptiveMarkers (or its 
		subclasses) shall be used.
	REQ_EP_150 (10.1)
		CommentMarkers shall be placed only in EventMobSlots.  
		DescriptiveMarkers may be placed in any kind of MobSlot (e.g. 
		TimelineMobSlot, EventMobSlot, StaticMobSlot).
	REQ_EP_151 (10.1)
		Exporting applications shall document all TaggedValues in use using 
		TaggedValueDefinition objects in the Dictionary::TaggedValueDefinitions
		property.
	REQ_EP_152 (10.1)
		Exporting applications shall document all KLVData in use in
		KLVDataDefinition objects in the Dictionary::KLVDefinitions property.
Warn Conditions:
	NONE
Fail Conditions:
	REQ_EP_147 - Fail if the number of UserComments on a component is greater
				 than zero, and the component is not a CommentMarker or the 
				 child of a MobSlot.
	REQ_EP_149 - Fail if a CommentMarker base class or subclass other than 
				 DescripteMarker and its subclasses) is included within an
				 essence track.
	REQ_EP_150 - Fail if a CommentMarker base class or subclass other than
				 DescriptiveMarker han an ancestor MobSlot that is not an
				 EventMobSlot.
	REQ_EP_151 - Fail if a TaggedValue has a name that does not have a
				 correspondingly named TaggedValueDefinition in the dictionary.
	REQ_EP_152 - Fail if a KLVData object has a key that does not have a
				 KLVDataDefinition with the same AUID in the dictionary.
Issues:   
33. Essence track is not defined.  It is assumed to 	be a MobSlot that has a
	Sound or Picture DataDefinition.

59. REQ_EP_149 and REQ_EP_150 prevent CommentMarkers from being used in places
	where DescriptiveMarkers are allowed.  It is assumed that CommentMarker
	refers to the base class and any subclass other than DescriptiveMarker and
	its subclasses.
	
60. REQ_EP_149 referes to classes included within an essence track.  It is
	assumed that this means any component that is a descendant (ie. contained
	within through some level of nesting), of a MobSlot.

Test Name:
	EPDefinitionTest
Description:
	Make sure DefinitionObjects are used properly.
Requirements Tested:
	REQ_EP_162 (11.1)
		An OperationDefinition object in an AAF file shall have a data
		definition value consistent with the data definition of an
		OperationGroup object that references it.
Warn Conditions:
	REQ_EP_162 - Present a warning if an OperationDefinition is in the
				 dictionary but is not referenced by an OperationGroup.
Fail Conditions:
	REQ_EP_162 - Fail if the data definition of an OperationGroup is not the
				 same as the data definition of the OperationDefinition that it
				 references.
Issues:   
61. It is assumed that for data definition values to be consistent in
	REQ_EP_162, AxDataDef::IsDataDefOf() must return true.
	
62. For REQ_EP_162 It is assumed that a warning should be presented if there is
	an OperationDefinition in the AAF file that is not referenced.
	
63. It is not possible to save an AAF file with an unreferenced
	OperationDefinition so the warn condition of REQ_EP_162 can not be tested.
	
Test Name:
	EPHeaderTest
Description:
	Make sure the Header of an AAF file is valid under the Edit Protocol.
Requirements Tested:
	REQ_EP_255 (15)
		Header::OperationalPattern should be equal to OpEditProtocol.
Warn Conditions:
	NONE
Fail Conditions:
	REQ_EP_255 - The Header::OperationPattern property is not present or not
				 equal to OpEditProtocol.
Issues:   
	NONE
	
Test Name:
	EPParameterTest
Description:
	Make sure all parameters in an AAF file are valid under the Edit Protocol.
Requirements Tested:
	REQ_EP_174 (11.5)
		Effect parameters shall be specified using ConstantValue or VaryingValue 
		objects.
	REQ_EP_175 (11.5.1)
		Interpolation between ControlPoints within VaryingValue objects shall be 
		specified as one of the following: ConstantInterpolator,
		LinearInterpolator, LogInterpolator, PowerInterpolator,
		BSplineInterpolator.
Warn Conditions:
	NONE
Fail Conditions:
	REQ_EP_174 - Fail if a Parameter that is not a ConstantValue or VaryingValue
				 (or a subclass) is encountered.
	REQ_EP_175 - Fail if a VaryingValue has an illegal interpolator definition.
Issues:   
69. It is assumed that sub-classes of ConstantValue and VaryingValue are legal
	for REQ_EP_174, but any other sub-class of Parameter is illegal.
	
70. There is no easy way to regression test REQ_EP_174 with the current testing
	framework.

Test Name:
	EPMultiChannelAudioTest
Description:
	Make sure use of multi-channel audio is acceptable under tha Edit Prorocol.
Requirements Tested:
	REQ_EP_110 (7.8)
		Within a CompositionMob or MasterMob, multi-channel audio shall be
		represented using multiple tracks with mono sound Data Definition.
		Within a CompositionMob or MasterMob, a multi-channel sound Data
		Definition shall not be used.
Warn Conditions:
	NONE
Fail Conditions:
	REQ_EP_110 - Fail if a Source Mob with a Sound Descriptor with more than
				 1 channel is found after traversing past a Composition or
				 Master Mob.
Issues:   
74. REQ_EP_110 referes to mono and multi-channel sound Data Definitions that do
	not exist.  It is assumed that these refer to sound descriptors with 1 or
	more than one channels respectively.
	
75. It is assumed that REQ_EP_110 means SoundDescriptors with multiple channels
	cannot occur in the derivation chain after a Composition or MasterMob.

Other Issues:

Requirements:
	REQ_EP_025 (6.3)
		A top-level composition shall be specified using a CompositionMob with

		composition shall not be referenced by another Mob in the AAF file.
	REQ_EP_030 (6.4)
		A lower-level composition shall be specified using a CompositionMob with

		A film source shall be specified using a SourceMob with a
		FilmDescriptor.
	DEF_EP_096 (7.2)
		Pull up and pull down shall be specified using a Pulldown object.
Issue:
16. Requirements REQ_EP_025, REQ_EP_030, DEF_EP_034, DEF_EP_043, DEF_EP_049,
    DEF_EP_054, DEF_EP_058, DEF_EP_071, DEF_EP_074, DEF_EP_080, DEF_EP_085 and
    DEF_EP_096 define terms used in the Edit Protocol.  Some of these
    requirements are used to find particular data, however, they can not
    generate a warning or a failure.  These should not be requirements, they
    should be definitions (ie. Instead of using shall, DEF_EP_043 should be
    rewritten as "Let an adjusted-clip composistion be defined as a
    CompositionMob with Mob::UsageCode property equal to Usage_AdjustedClip".
    These requirements can not be tested.

Requirements:
	REQ_EP_013 (6.1)
		An application shall export each clip using one of the methods described
		in Section 6.1 of the AAF Edit Protocol.
	REQ_EP_014 (6.1)
		An application shall import clips that use any of the methods described
		in Section 6.1 of the AAF Edit Protocol.
	REQ_EP_039 (6.5.1)
		A CompositionMob with Mob::UsageCode property equal to Usage_SubClip
		shall be treated as a sub-clip composition.
Issue:
17. REQ_EP_013, REQ_EP_014 and REQ_EP_039 are all classified as file
    requirements but they seem dependant on an importing or exporting
    application.  They are not currently being tested.

Requirements:
	REQ_EP_023 (6.2.1)
		Within a Two-Parameter Audio Dissolve effect a CompositionMob may use a
		SourceClip object to reference a TimelineMobSlot beyond the extent of
		the TimelineMobSlot (before the begining or after the end).
	REQ_EP_097 (7.2)
		A Pulldown may be used in the following contexts: 1. In a
		TimelineMobSlot of a file SourceMob, where the Pulldown object contains
		a SourceClip referencing a tape SourceMob; 2. In a TimelineMobSlot of a
		tape SourceMob, where the Pulldown object contains a SourceClip
		referencing a film SourceMob; 3. In a TimelineMobSlot of a tape
		SourceMob, where the Pulldown object contains a SourceClip referenceing
		a tape SourceMob.
Issue:
18. REQ_EP_023 and REQ_EP_097 are optional ("MAY") requirements.  There is no
    way they can present a warning or a failure - they are not currently being
    tested.
	
Requirements:
	REQ_EP_056 (6.8)
		A MasterMob shall not reference more than one essence track of a
		particular file source from each time position in the MasterMob.
Issue:
32. What does REQ_EP_056 mean?
	
Requirements:
	NONE
Issue:
54. Currently, if a test fails or issues a warning, traversal down the current
	path will be terminated.  This could mask further warnings or failures.  In
	some cases, there is no choice but to do this (ie. Once a mob/clip is out of
	place in the derivation chain, it is not possible to verify if further
	mobs/clips are in the correct place), however, in other cases, it is should
	be possible to continue testing (ie. any non-structural test).  Switching
	the tests to continue along the chain should not effect the	regression tests
	unless noted within the XML files.
	
Requirements:
	NONE
Issue:
71. When building the test graph, it is assumed that properties with a Record
	data type will not contain any strong references.  According to the AAF
	object specification, strong references are allowed.  If stong references
	are used from records, the test graph will be incomplete.  Furthermore, it
	is assumed that property's with data types of FixedArray or VariableArray
	will not be arrays of Indirect or Opaque data types.  It is also assumed
	that the Rename data type will not be used with a base data type of Indirect
	or Opaque.  The AAF object specification allows Indirects and Opaques to be
	used in this way and if this assumption is incorrect, the AAF Analyzer will
	throw an exception and terminate before analyzing the file.

Requirements:
	REQ_EP_012 (5)
		Where the feature set of an exporting application supports program
		metadata that the Edit Protocol specifically disallows (e.g. a program
		consisting of different audio sample rates which is disallowed in
		Section 7.3), the application shall not export that metadata to an Edit
		Protocol AAF file.  The omission of any metadata on export in order to
		comply with the Edit Protocol should be logged.
	REQ_EP_062 (6.9)
		When exporting an AAF file containing relative URIs, the exporting 
		application should also export the target resources.
	REQ_EP_160 (11.1)
		All effects in an AAF file shall be defined with OperationDefinition and
		ParameterDefinition objects in the Dictionary.
Issue:
72. Should REQ_EP_012, REQ_EP_062 and REQ_EP_160 be FILE requirements?

Requirements:
	NONE
Issue:
73. Currently, error messages attempt to indicate which object in an AAF file
	causes a warning or a failure.  However, there are many cases where
	objects are hard to identify.  TestResult could be modified so that each
	failure and warning is associated with a node of the test graph.  This would
	be of minimal value with the current text-based interface, however, if a GUI
	is added, or the -dump functionality is extended, the node id could be very
	useful in identifying the problem object.
