<P> How do I get started with the AAF project at SourceForge ?</P>
SourceForge is at<a href="%20http://sourceforge.net/"> http://sourceforge.net/</a> 
The SourceForge Project Info page for AAF is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aaf/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/aaf/ 
</a>and the Developer Support Webpages are at <a href="http://aaf.sourceforge.net">http://aaf.sourceforge.net</a> 
<P> How do I obtain and build the AAF SDK ?</P>
The following notes describe "Anonymous CVS Access" to the AAF source code. Such 
access is read only. For read/write access please see <a href="#howDev">How do 
I become an AAF developer ?</a>. This note describes how to build the reference 
implementation only. Some of the AAF source files are automatically generated, 
the process described here uses pre-generated versions of those source files that 
have been checked into CVS. See <a href="#regenSrc">How do I regenerate the generated 
source files ?</a> regenerating the generated source files. 
<P> How do I obtain and build the AAF SDK on Windows NT/Windows 2000 ?</p>

<P>OK, I've built the thing, what do I do now ?</P>
First, try running the module test program.<br>
This test is self validating if you see the following output then you probably 
have a correct build.<br>

module test program is ...<br>
Windows COMMODAAF.EXE<br>
Macintosh COMMODAAF (PPC)<br>
Linux ComModAAF Next, try running the example programs.<br>
Examine the source code and project settings (GNUmakefile) for the examples.<br>
This will show you how to get started implementing AAF in your own applications.

<p>How do I make checkins ?</P>
<p>What's ssh ?</p>
SSH stands for <i>Secure SHell</i>. see this<a href="http://www.cert.org/security-improvement/implementations/i062_01.html">

Note that you can't easily use the CVS workspace or sandbox you checked out anonymously 
with your developer account because all the CVS directories embedded in your checked 
out workspace contain a <b>Root</b> file specifing the original checkout parameters.<br>
Although this can be overriden by explicitly forcing a new access method with 
each command<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="+1"><br>

<p>Help - Redhat Linux 6.1 doesn't come with ssh pre-installed !</p>
Unlike Redhat 7.x. you have to install ssh from an RPM. Note that SSH 2.0 can 
be used despite notes to the contrary on SourceForge that state only SSH 1.5 is 
supported. 
<p>I get errors first time I use SSH access to SourceForge what's going on ?</p>
SourceForge does not create a home directory for you until you attempt a real

<P> What kinds of changes are allowed ?</P>
You may add new interfaces. 
<P> What kinds of change are NOT allowed ?</P>
You may not change existing interfaces. Here <b>interface</b> means interface 
in the COM sense. e.g. IAAFEssenceAccess as defined in AAF.idl You may not change 
existing interfaces as this would break binary compatibility. Binary compatibility 
is the ability of an existing explication (perhaps one developed with an older 
<b>aafdll</b>) to work correctly with a newer <b>aafdll</b>. In the newer <b>aafdll</b> 
interfaces must not have changed otherwise code in the old application will not 
work correctly. Newer applications can take advantage of new interfaces in in 
the new <b>aafdll</b> that will simply be ignored by older applications. <!--[Note to FAQ maintainer - this is _very_ important. I'm concerned
about recent discussions to _change_ the EssenceAccess
interface. Doing so would be incorrect.] -->Another advantage of maintaining binary 
compatibility is that bugs can be fixed "at run time". That is, if an older <b>aafdll</b> 
contains bugs, a newer one with the bugs fixed can only be substituted safely 
provided that no interfaces have been changed. 
<P> How do I add a new interface ?</P>
You'll need to speak to "dodo" :-)<!--

[TBS - but seriously] --> 
<P> How are changes approved ?</P>
The AAF engineering committee is responsible for defining this process.<!--

[TBS - more detail, or a web link, needed on exactly what the process is.]
 --> 
<P> What are the rules for interface design. I notice that there are no parameters 
  of built-in type, such as "int" ?</P>
<ul>
  <li>no parameters of built-in type such as "int" since the sizes of the builtin 
    type vary (across platforms, between compiler on the same platform and even 
    for the same compiler with different options).</li>
  <li> no parameters of type enum (same reasons as above)</li>
  <li>no hidden pointers (e.g. as a struct member) <!--[reason - TBS]

  - [others - TBS]
 --> 
    <HR>
  </li>
</ul>
<P> What platforms are supported ?</P>
<p>As of RC1 (the initial sources made available on SourceForge April 17, 2001) 
  the supported platforms are (in no particular order) </p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows NT Version 4.0 Intel Visual C++ Version 6.0 (Service Pack 2)</li>
  <li>Windows 2000 Professional Intel Visual C++ Version 6.0 (Service Pack 2)</li>
  <li>Macintosh Mac OS 8.6 PPC Code Warrior 5 (IDE 4.0.4)</li>
  <li>Macintosh Mac OS 9.2 PPC Code Warrior 6 (IDE 4.1)</li>
  <li>Red Hat Linux 6.0 Intel gcc <!--[version TBS] --></li>
  <li>Red Hat Linux 6.1 Intel gcc 2.95.2</li>
  <li>Red Hat Linux 7.1 Intel gcc 2.96 [some functions NYI as of 5/25/01]</li>
  <li>SGI Irix 6.5 MIPS gcc 2.95.2</li>
  <li>SGI Irix 6.5 MIPS MIPSpro 7.2.1 (CC -n32)</li>
</ul>
<br>The above platforms are those on which the AAF project is known to build and 
  run correctly.
<p>
Will the SDK compile with gcc 3.0 ?
</p>
No yet, Note gcc versions prior to 3.0 don't have support for wide
streams (wostreams). I discovered this problem in gcc version 2.96.
no-one has yet made any effort to fix this problem.
<br>
gcc 2.96 also has problems with basic_string<wchar_t>::c_str().  3.0
fixes that as well.  (It looks like std lib string support was
completely redone in 3.0)

<P> What's the earliest MacOS that the SDK will work on ?</P>
MacOS 8.6 is the earliest on which we've tested RC1. 
<P> What about Macintosh OSX ?</P>
One dependency here is on a Carbonized version of the <b>Microsoft Structured 
Storage</b> system extension. This is not yet available from Microsoft. 
<P> Does AAF build with CodeWarrior 6.0 ?</P>
Not quite there are syill a couple of outstanding Link problems 31/7/01. 
<P> <a name="win9598MEsupport">What about Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME 
  ?</a></P>
For brevity, let's refer collectively to Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME 
as consumer versions of Windows. <br>
We have not tested building and running AAF on consumer versions Windows as we 
have on the "supported" platforms. However AAF does build and run on consumer 
versions of Windows after some minor modifications to the Visual C++ projects. 
<br>
To be able to build and run AAF on a consumer version of Windows you must change 
the C/C++ settings in the following projects ...<br>
<br>
./AAFWinSDK/ref-impl/aaflib/AAFLIB.dsp<br>
./AAFWinSDK/ref-impl/Om/Om.dsp<br>
./AAFWinSDK/DevUtils/Dump/Dump.dsp <br>
<br>
Go to Settings -&gt; C/C++ -&gt; General -&gt; Preprocessor Definitions and add 
-DNO_W32_WFOPEN (make sure "Settings for:" says "All Configurations")<br>
If you wish to create a single <b>aafdll</b> that runs on consumer versions of 
Windows and on Windows Nt/2000, then different changes would be required.
<P> What other tools will I need besides a C++ compiler ?</P>
GNU make version 3.77<br>
Perl version 5.002
<!--
For "Anonymous CVS Access" to the AAF 
project on SourceForge you need a CVS client. We suggest the following clients 
Operating System CVS Client Available from Windows NT/Windows 2000 WinCvs http://www.wincvs.org/ 
Macintosh Mac OS 8.6/9.0 MacCVS Pro http://www.maccvs.org/ Note that there are 
several other Macintosh CVS clients with similar sounding names. On Linux we suggest 
the the cvs(1) command. 
For brevity, let's refer collectively to Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows ME 
as consumer versions of Windows. We have not tested building and running AAF on 
consumer versions Windows as we have the above platforms. However AAF does build 
and run on consumer versions of Windows after some minor source code modifications. 
To be able to build and run AAF on a consumer version of Windows you must make 
the following changes. In the following files change the implementation of wfopen() 
so that the non-Windows code is compiled even though you are compiling on Windows 
95 or 98. This is necessary because, although _wfopen() exists and is implemented 
in the W32 API on Windows 95 and 98, it always fails. ./ref-impl/aaflib/aaflib.cpp 
./ref-impl/src/OM/OMUtilities.cpp If you want to use the low-level file dumper 
on Windows 95 or 98 you'll need to make a similar change in the following file 
... ./DevUtils/Dump/dump.cpp If you wish to create a single <b>aafdll</b> that 
runs on consumer versions of Windows and on Windows NT/2000, different changes 
would be required. 
<P> What about Red Hat Linux version 7.1 ?</P>
As of RC1 (the initial sources made available on SourceForge April 17, 2001) AAF 
does not build on Red Hat Linux version 7.1. [Note to FAQ maintainer, I've since 
ported AAF to Red Hat Linux version 7.1 and checked the changes into SourceForge. 
I have notes on what I did. There are still a few warnings. I didn't bother getting 
the AAF/OMF converter to compile since there's no version of OMF for Linux yet. 
Also remaining to be done are implementations of the functions AafPos2AnsiPos() 
and AnsiPos2AafPos() in ref-impl/plugins/CAAFEssenceFileStream.cpp] 
<P>When I open up AAFWinSDK.dsw I get a message "Unable to connect to source code 
  control project AAFStandardCodecs". How can I get rid of this ?</P>
What's happening is that you have Visual Source Safe (Microsoft's source control 
product) installed as well as Visual Studio, Visual Source Safe is insisting on 
looking for a source control project even though none exists.<BR>
You can get rid of the message temporarily (the setting is saved in AAFWinSDK.opt) 
by answering "no" to the question "Do you wish to attempt this connection in future 
sessions ?" To get rid of the message permanently, change the value of the registry 
key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\6.0\Source Control\Disabled 
from 0 to 1. This part of the registry contains all the settings from the Visual 
Studio -&gt; Tools -&gt; Options ... -&gt; Source Contol dialog. Unfortunately 
it seems that there's no UI checkbox to disable Visual Studio/Visual Source Safe 
integration. For more details see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q236/3/99.ASP">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q236/3/99.ASP</A> 
<P> Where can I find out more about CVS ?</P>
There's information to help you get started on SourceForge<br>
<img src="fogelBook.gif" width="111" height="140" align="right" alt="Fogel CVS book">One 
book CVS I have found useful is Karl Franz Fogel, "OpenSource Development with 
CVS", November 1999, The Coriolis Group, ISBN: 1576104907. Most of this is available 
online at <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/">http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/</a><br>
<br>
There's a catalog of CVS documentation at <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/index.html">http://www.cvshome.org/docs/</a> 
I've found the PDF version of the "the Cederqvist" - the "official" CVS manual 
by Per Cederqvist most useful. There's also the book by Per Cederqvist "Version 
Management With CVS", December 2000, iUniverse.com, ISBN: 0595149219. I'm not 
sure how this differs from the stuff by Cederqvist that's available online. 
<P> My line endings are messed up. What's going on ?</P>
CVS rules for text files. - files are stored in the CVS repository with Unix line 
endings. - the CVS client converts the CVS repository line endings to/from the 
endings appropriate to your platform when you commit/checkout the file. - the 
conversions performed by the CVS client are dumb in that they expect the input 
file to have the correct line endings for their platform i.e. they convert a valid 
file rather than fix up an invalid one. So if the file starts out with the wrong 
line endings for the CVS client that is used to check it in, then the file will 
get mangled. e.g. checking in a file with Windows line endings using a Macintosh 
CVS client will probably transform "\r\n" to "\n\n", if you check this file out 
you'll see an extra blank line between every existing line. Adding a text file 
- before you add a text file make sure the file has the line endings appropriate 
to the platform from which you are adding the file. Fixing a file - checkout the 
file, convert the line ending to those appropriate to your platform (remembering 
that they may have been mangled) and then check it back in. CVS will do the right 
thing from then on. Line ending conventions Unix \n Windows \r \n Macintosh \r 
<P>My binary file is messed up. What's going on ?</P>
Chances are the file isn't correctly tagged as binary in CVS, check the CVS/Entries
file for the current directory files that were orginally added as binary have the -kb flag against them.
<p>I get the error message &quot;Connection refused&quot; from Sourceforge ?</p>
<p>usw-pr-cvs.sourceforge.net: Connection refused cvs [history aborted]:end of 
  file from server (consult above messages if any</p>
Check you have a <b>CVS_RSH</b> environment variable correctly set to <b>SSH</b>
<p>How can I add a MacOS alias (symbolic link or shortcut) to CVS ?<p>
Use MacCVSpro, it seems to be smart enough to figure out the special type and convert it to Apple single.
<HR>
<P> What are the pieces of the AAF project ?</P>
The AAF project consists of the following pieces - Tools needed to generate some 
of the AAF source files together with input files for those tools. Pre-generated 
files are included since they don't always need to be regenerated. - The complete 
source code for the AAF reference implementation - Other components upon which 
the AAF project depends - OMF header files and libraries - Microsoft Structured 
Storage - On Macintosh this is part of Mac OLE (header files and libraries are 
included in the AAF project) - On Windows the header files and libraries are part 
of the Microsoft supplied platform SDK (not included in the AAF project) - On 
other platforms the Microsoft Structured Storage reference implementation is used 
(header files and libraries for Linux (Intel) and SGI Irix are included in the 
AAF project. For other platforms the source code for the Structured Storage reference 
implementation can be licensed from Microsoft.) - Module tests, one per AAF class 
- Test programs - Example programs - Utility programs 
<P> What are the steps in the process of building an AAF SDK from the AAF project 
  ?</P>
<ol>
  <li>generate files 
    <ul>
      <li>build dodo tool </li>
      <li>run dodo tool to generate files</li>
    </ul>
  <li>build AAF reference implementation </li>
  <li>create SDK</li>
  <li>build tests using SDK</li>
  <li>build examples using SDK</li>
</ol>
<p>These are <b>all</b> of the steps. Step 1 isn't necessary unless you've changed 
  the dodo inputs files. To avoid everyone having to do step 1 the generated files 
  are checked in to CVS. Note that regenerating the source files isn't done (by 
  default) by the projects or makefile. <!--TBS - more detail on each of the steps.--> 
</p>
<P> <a name="regenSrc">How do I regenerate the generated source files ?</a></P>
To regenerate the generated files you need to "cd dodo; make". There is one caveat 
which only applies if you want to regenerate the generated source files, for example, 
if you are adding a new interface to the AAF API. Up to date generated source 
files as well as the files from which they are derived are checked into CVS. However, 
when you download them from CVS, "make" may think that the generated files need 
to be regenerated (since the files get modification times corresponding to the 
time that the working copy is created and not when the file was checked in to 
CVS). 
<P> Why does "cvs checkout" take so long ?</P>
If you are using a slow (e.g. 56K or ISDN) link consider setting the CVS compression 
option<b> cvs -z3</b> (tune the compression level for best results), compression 
is tradeoff between the horsepower available at each end of the link compared 
to the thickness of the pipe.<br>
<br>
Make sure you are checking out the platform specific module such as <b>AAFWinSDK</b> 
rather than the default <b>AAF</b> module which contains the entire source tree.<br>
<br>
For the time being if you just want the pre-built SDK for you platform you'll also 
get the source code needed to build it. <br>
After the first checkout a <b>cvs update -d</b> command will be considerably faster 
since it only needs to retrieve the changed files and new directories.<br>
<br>
Modules still need to be defined for - pre-built SDKs on Windows, Macintosh and 
Unix (these will also be made available as "released files").<br>
These modules would be checked out by those wishing only to <i>use</i> the AAF 
SDK. <br>
These users could also be satisfied by pre-built SDKs in the form of "released 
file packages". - everything needed to be a reference implementation developer 
(i.e. make a change, such as a bug fix to some existing code.)<br>
These modules would be checked out by those wishing to enhance the AAF SDK and 
by those who wish to port the SDK to a new platform. - everything needed to add 
new interfaces to AAF. This would include the dodo tool. This would be done by 
those wishing to extend the set of interfaces supported by AAF. 
<P> I just want to use the AAF SDK, why do I have to build it first ?</P>
Because CVS modules and/or "released file packages" are not yet available. 
<P> What is dodo ?</P>
dodo is a tool used to generate some of the AAF source files. It allows multiple 
output files, that must be kept in sync with each other, to be generated from 
a single source. If you need to make a change that has an impact in more than 
one place you need only change the dodo input file. The original idea for dodo 
was that all the files it generated would eventually be maintained by hand at 
which point dodo could be made extinct. Hence the name "dodo". However, dodo was 
useful enough that it became used for code that is always generated, meaning that 
dodo must be kept alive.

<P>Why does making dodo on Win2K fail with UNAME := $(shell uname) ?</P>

The above is a GNUmake specific construct (It means run the uname command in the
shell and put the output in the make symbol UNAME). You need GNUmake to use this
makefile. GNUmake should be listed as one of the prerequisites for building Dodo on
Windows.
<br>
Since the generated files are checked in to SourceForge you don't need to run
dodo unless you are adding a new interface (you aren't allowed to change
existing interfaces) or changing the generated code (in a compatible way).

<!--

<HR>
<P> I get the following error from CodeWarrior when building from scratch. Error 
  : ### Error: Out of memory ### Link Error : Link failed. </p>
I've seen this error too but could never track it down. It seems only to happen 
when compiling and linking from scratch and seems also to be related to the amount 
of memory allocated to CodeWarrior (oddly enough allocating more memory seemed 
to cause it more often). The error goes away if you try again. 
<P> I get an out of memory error from CodeWarrior 6 when building <b>ModuleTests/CAAFDictionaryTest.cpp</b></p>
This test does #include files like  AAFStoredObjectIDs.h, AAFTypeDefUIDs.h and
AAFClassDefUIDs.h which do a lot of macro expansion via AAFMetaDictionary.h it seems to need more than 128MB for this !
<HR>
<P> When I build on Macintosh I get warnings. What's the house style guide say 
  on the acceptability of Warnings ?</P>
These warnings should be cleaned up, most are unused argument errors but some 
could indicate more serious problems. The intent is that warnings are not acceptable 
and that the compiler should be set to the highest level of warnings as is practicable, 
if possible the compiler should be set to treat all warnings as errors. For gcc 
this means "-Wall -Werror". 
<HR>
<P> When I build on Irix I get the following error. What's going on ?</P>
"../../include/OM/OMContainerElement.h", line 36: error(1020): identifier "typename" 
is undefined<br>
You are using the wrong compiler (probably "CC -o32") this compiler is so old 
it doesn't recognize the "typename" keyword. Use "CC -n32" or gcc instead. 
<HR>
<P> On Linux the default make at the top level doesn't descend all the branches, 
  it only seems to build in ref-impl. Is this correct ?</P>
Yes, this is correct for the default make file target. The default target (make 
with no arguments) is the reference implementation libraries. There are a number 
of other targets in the makefile. Here's an overview of the makefile targets. 
<br>
<!--[Note to FAQ maintainer, I didn't have time to edit this for consistency.] -->To 
build AAF reference implementation libraries type: make<br>
Now you have to install libraries and header files to create AAF SDK to use with 
your applications:<br>
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">make install</font> or <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">make 
install AAFSDK=/home/user/New_AAF_SDK</font><br>
You can do 'make install' without doing 'make' first. If 'make install' cannot 
find libraries to install it will build them.<br>
With SDK created you now can build applications. To build applications distributed 
with the AAF SDK you can do:<br>
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">make test<br>
make examples<br>
make utilities<br>
make devutils </font><br>
or make everything<br>
If make cannot find installed AAF SDK it will build (if necessary) and install 
the SDK before building applications.<br>
Binaries are placed in the SDK's bin directory. Do not forget that if you use 
install directory other than default you have to specify it:<br>
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">make everything AAFSDK=/home/user/AAF_2001 
</font> 
<p>How about cleaning up ?</p>
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">make clean</font> will remove: all the 
intermediate files (like .o for), libraries (except installed SDK libraries), 
and applications (tests, examples, utilities).<br>
To remove SDK do make uninstall which removes all the installed libraries and 
header files. Again, don't forget that you may need to use: make clean AAFSDK=/usr/local/aaf 
make uninstall AAFSDK=/usr/local/aaf 
<p>What about running dodo ?</p>
Dodo is utility to generate COM interfaces. By default all the generated files 
are already there and do not get touched by commands mentioned above. If you want 
to remove generated files along with compiled files do: make realclean 'make realclean' 
does 'make uninstall', 'make clean' and then removes all the generated files created 
by the dodo tool. Want to skip 'unistall' and 'clean'? Do: cd dodo; make realclean 
With generated files missing the next try to build the SDK ('make') will launch 
dodo to generate them. If you want just generate files without building anything 
do: cd dodo; make 
<P> When building on Linux I get errors because the directory "AAFi686LinuxSDK/g++/bin/debug/" 
  does not exist. What's going on ?</P>
Most likely you are trying to make in the examples directory before running <b>make 
install</b> at the top level to create the target directories.

<P> What are the major components of the AAF architecture ?</P>
<ul>
  <li>The AAF (COM) API (ref-impl/src/com-api) <!--[TBS - more detail needed] --></li>
  <li> The AAF Data Model Manager (ref-impl/src/impl)<!--[TBS - more detail needed] --></li>
  <li>The Object Manager (ref-impl/include/OM and ref-impl/src/OM) <!--[TBS - more detail

</ul>
<P> What's the run time architecture ?</P>
You link your application to a small static library <b>aaflib</b> which exports 
a small number of entry points, such as AAFFileOpenExistingRead(). <br>
At run time, code in <b>aaflib</b> dynamically loads <b>aafdll</b>, the actual 
guts of the AAF reference implementation, and resolves these symbols.<br>
You must also link your application to <b>aafiid</b> a static library that defines 
the IIDs (Interface identifiers) for the AAF interfaces. 
<P> What are the libraries called and where is their code ?</P>
The actual library files have names that vary across platforms. The platform specific 
names are given in the table below. To refer to a library in a platform independent 
way I've used names such as <b>aaflib</b>, <b>aafiid</b> and <b>aafdll</b>.

<P> What are AAFINTP.DLL and AAFPGAPI.DLL ?</P>
AAFINTP.DLL is an example interpolator plugin and AAFPGAPI.DLL is an example essence 
codec plugin (AIFC, CDCI, WAVE and JPEG codecs). The AAFPGAPI.DLL also contains 
the external essence container code as well as the essence data stream helper 
class. If future it would be a good idea to move the essence data helper class 
into "aafdll" (inside the AAF essence access class). 
<HR>
<P> What's all that funny stuff like "@mfunc" and "@rdesc" in the comments of 
  the source files in ref-impl/src/OM and ref-impl/include/OM ?</P>
These are special comments recognized by AutoDuck (AutoDuck is Freeware by Eric 
Artzt). AutoDuck extracts the comments and produces documentation in a variety 
of formats. While AutoDuck is not particularly smart about C++ (e.g. it gets confused 
about overloaded functions) the hyperlinked html output is very useful. 
<p>Where can I get Autoduck from ?</p>
try <a href="http://www.devstuff.com/utils.htm">http://www.devstuff.com/utils.htm</a> 
note there are some older versions around that don't do HTML 
<P> OK, where can I get the html ?</P>
Run the script ref-impl/doc/OM/makedocs.ksh. Note that this script expects that 
you already have Autoduck (AFAIK only available for Windows) and that documentation 
only for the Object Manager (ref-impl/src/OM and ref-impl/include/OM) will be 
generated. 
<HR>
<P> What do I need to port AAF to a new platform ?</P>
- a C++ compiler of recent vintage. We don't insist on ISO/ANSI since we've deliberately 
avoided some of the really new features. We do however, use some of the more well 
establish features. gcc (g++) is recommended. - an implementation of Microsoft 
Structured Storage for your platform. <!--[TBS]

 --> 
<P> Don't I need an implementation of COM ?</P>
No. 
<P> Are you sure I don't I need an implementation of COM ?</P>
Yes, we're sure. 
<P> How is the Microsoft COM stuff distributed for Irix &amp; Linux - it seems 
  to miraculously work, is there a binary lib tucked away in the Distribution 
  ?</P>
No it really is a miracle :-) Seriously,<!-- <a href="../COMaaf.html"> see </a>[TBS - more detail needed on how we don't really use COM] --> 
<P> OK. So what C++ features does the code use and which does it avoid ?</P>
- Features we use - "bool" - class templates (including "typename") - static_cast&lt;&gt;, 
dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;, const_cast&lt;&gt; and reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt; - Features 
we have avoided - "mutable" - "namespace" - standard template library - class 
type_info, typeid operator - function templates - class/function template specialization 
- class/function template partial specialization - covariant virtual function 
return types - unbound friend class/function template declarations - Other - note 
that we do use wchar_t from &lt;stddef.h&gt; and the wcs functions (e.g. wcslen()) 
from &lt;wchar.h&gt;. Since this is a relatively new addition to the ISO C libraries 
it may raise portability issues. 
<HR>
<P> I thought the AAF code was supposed to be portable, why does the code contain 
  references to IStorage and IStream ? Aren't those Windows specific things ?</P>
AAF is portable, however it does depend on Microsoft Structured Storage. IStorage 
and IStream are interfaces with implementations in Microsoft Structured Storage. 
Implementations of Microsoft Structured Storage for Windows and Macintosh are 
available directly from Microsoft and are included (headers and binaries) with 
AAF. On other platforms it is possible to licence the source code for the Structured 
Storage reference implementation from Microsoft. Header files and binaries for 
Linux and Irix are included. 
<P> <a name="#OMdebug"></a>Why does the Object Manager (ref-impl/src/OM and ref-impl/include/OM) 
  depend on &lt;iostream.h&gt; ?</P>
The release build does not. The debug build does. The default configuration for 
the debug build defines OM_DEBUG which enables run-time assertion checking. 
If an assertion fails information about the failing assertion is written to "omlog" 
an instance of class OMOStream. The distributed version of OMOStream is implemented 
using &lt;iostream.h&gt; (only four functions in OMOStream.cpp). If you don't 
have (or don't want to use) &lt;iostream.h&gt; you can either reimplement the 
four functions in OMOStream.cpp or change the body of function reportAssertionViolation() 
in OMAssertions.cpp to do something different. 
<HR>
<P> Why does it say "This Project Has Not Released Any Files" on https://sourceforge.net/projects/aaf/, 
  I thought that all of the source for AAF had been released ?</P>
Here "released files" refers to the output of a project, in the form of "file 
packages" or "tarballs") ready for use by others. The SourceForge AAF project 
has not yet released any file packages these will probably be in the form of pre-built 
AAF SDKs for various platforms 
<HR>
<P> What are the TRACE(), PRECONDITION(), POSTCONDITION() and ASSERT() calls in 
  the Object Manager (ref-impl/src/OM and ref-impl/include/OM) ?</P>
The macros support the use of design and programming by contract. See Bertrand 
Meyer, "Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition", March, 2000, Prentice 
Hall, ISBN: 0136291554

<!--[Note to FAQ maintainer - This is not completely accurate, I didn't
have time to check and edit this.] -->Here's a brief guide to the AAF Source Tree, 
focusing on where to find useful bits of information. 
<h4>AAFWinSDK</h4>
<p>Windows project files and default location for compiles and links (Windows 
  platform only)</p>
<h4>bin</h4>
<p>Obsolete</p>
<h4>DevUtils</h4>
<p>Utilities useful to AAF Developers.<br>
  There's only one of these, a low-level dumper that helps diagnose file format 
  problems.</p>
<h4>doc</h4>
<p>Currently obsolete, will have doc files </p>
<h4>dodo</h4>
<p><a href="http://aaf.sourceforge.net/dodo.html">dodo</a> is a tool we use to generate our header files.<br>
  This directory contains the dodo input file (*.dod). The dodo input files use 
  macros defined in *.mac files in the macros directory. The comments in the *.dod 
  files end up in the <a href="http://aaf.sourceforge.net/doc/com-api/contentsf.html">API reference document</a>.</p>
<h4>examples</h4>
<p>Useful examples and some useful dump utilities meta Spreadsheet that defines 
  the AAF object model, used to generate the AAFMetaDictionary.h file and the 
  dictionary stored in the AAF file. (see ref-impl/src/impl for definitions used 
  by the reference implementation for builtins)</p>
<h4>omf</h4>
<p>OMF toolkit headers and libraries for the OMF converter</p>
<h4>ref-impl</h4>
<p>Sources for the Com interfaces and the implementation code.</p>
<h4>ref-impl/aafiid</h4>
<h4>ref-impl/aaflib</h4>
<h4>ref-impl/bld_cfg</h4>
<h4>ref-impl/include</h4>
<p>Contains the .idl and .h files used by the implementation (including those 
  exported to AAF clients). The top-level include directory has the include files 
  that are not generated from .idl files.<br>
  AAFClassDefsUIDs.h defines the macros for defining the symbols and AUIDs for 
  the stored classes, but does not contain the list of symbols and the AUIDs. 
  The symbols for a class ID is in the format kAAFClassID_&lt;class-name&gt; However, 
  the implementation code uses some shortened names for these symbols and AAFClassDefsUIDs.h 
  defines symbols with the longer name. In general, the following abbreviations 
  are used </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="6">

</table>
<p>In addition, there are a few symbols defined for multiple spellings (UNIX and 
  Unix, EdgeCode and Edgecode)<br>
  <b>AAFPropertyDefs.h</b> defines the macros for defining AUIDs for property 
  ID and AAFPropertyIDs.h invokes the macros, but neither contains the symbol 
  and the AUID defined for each property. The symbol for a property is in the 
  format kAAFPropID_&lt;class-name&gt;_&lt;property-name&gt; with the added complication 
  that the class-name used is the modified short name used in the code. </p>
<h4>ref-impl/include/com-api</h4>
<p>Contains the .idl files for the Com interfaces.</p>
<p><b>AAF.idl</b> defines the interfaces and methods and AAFTypes.idl defines 
  the types ref-impl/include/om Contains the header files used internally by AAF 
  data manager for the AAF object manager</p>
<h4>ref-impl/include/ref-api</h4>
<p>Contains the .h files generated from the .idl files and private .h files used 
  by the AAF data manager</p>
<h4>ref-impl/libjpeg</h4>
<p> Contains jpeg source code used by the JPEG codecs with the CDCI format.</p>
<h4>ref-impl/plugins</h4>
<p> Contains the source code used by the plugins provided with the reference implementation. 
  These plugins are AIFC codec, JPEG codec, WAVE codec, Interpolator plugin, Plugin 
  manager code</p>
<!-- ??? anything else --> 
<h4>ref-impl/src</h4>
<p> Contains the source code for the reference implementation</p>
<h4>ref-impl/src/com-api</h4>
<p> Contains the source code for the Com interfaces. The top-level directory contains 
  the .cpp and .h file for each Com interface. <b>CAAFAIFCDescriptor.cpp</b> contains 
  the source code associated with the AAFAIFCDescriptor class. In general the 
  methods in the Com interfaces call methods of the same name in the implementation 
  object. The .h files contain the information about which interfaces an implementation 
  object supports. In general, for Com objects that are associated with AAF Specification 
  classes, the implementation object will support the Com interface associated 
  with the stored class and the Com interfaces associated with the parent class 
  of the stored class.<br>
  This is indicated by the lines that start the class definition in the .h file.<br>
  For example, the AAFFiller stored class inherits from the AAFSegment clas</p>
<p> class CAAFFiller : public IAAFFiller, public CAAFSegment</p>
<p>In addition, some implementation objects support additional interfaces.<br>
  For example, the implementation class associated with the <b>AAFMasterMob</b> 
  class also supports the <b>IAAFSearchSource</b> interface.<br>
  This is shown by the following lines in the<b> CAAFMasterMob.h</b> file:</p>
<p>class CAAFMasterMob : public IAAFMasterMob, public IAAFSearchSource, public 
  CAAFMob</p>
<h4>ref-impl/src/com-api/com-dll</h4>
<p><!--?? -->Contains the code managing loading the AAF .dll and creating Com 
  objects.</p>
<h4>ref-impl/src/impl</h4>
<p>Contains the .cpp and .h files that define the implementation objects.<br>
  The <b>Impl&lt;class-name&gt;.cpp</b> contains the body of the code.<br>
  The <b>Impl&lt;lclass-name&gt;.h</b> files contains the header and specifies 
  the actual datatypes used by the implementation for builtin properties.<br>
  These types should match the ones specified in the meta directory and in the 
  metadictionary.h file. The property datatypes are specified in the end of the 
  .h file in under the private label.<br>
  The datatypes are specified in the underlying object manager type with the typedef 
  name of the property datatype name.<br>
  For example,<b> ImplAAFPulldown.h</b> specifies the following properties and 
  types:</p>
<p> OMStrongReferenceProperty&lt;ImplAAFSegment&gt; _inputSegment;<br>
  OMFixedSizeProperty&lt;aafPulldownKind_t&gt; _pulldownKind;<br>
  OMFixedSizeProperty&lt;aafPulldownDir_t&gt; _pulldownDirection;<br>
  OMFixedSizeProperty&lt;aafPhaseFrame_t&gt;_phaseFrame;</p>
<p>And in <b>ImpleAAFMobSlot.h</b>, the following properties are listed:</p>
<p>OMWideStringProperty _name;<br>
  OMFixedSizeProperty&lt;aafUInt32&gt; _trackID;<br>
  OMFixedSizeProperty&lt;aafUInt32&gt; _physicalTrackNum;<br>
  OMStrongReferenceProperty&lt;ImplAAFSegment&gt; _segment; </p>
<h4>ref-impl/src/om</h4>
<p>Contains the source for the AAF object manager</p>
<!-- ReleaseNotes Contains the release notes --> 
<h4>test</h4>
<p>Contains the test files</p>
<h4>test/com/ComModTestAAF</h4>
<p>Contains the module tests. This contains the module test test bed. To run individual 
  module tests, specify the class names as command line parameters.</p>
<h4>test/com/ComMobTestAAF/ModuleTests</h4>
<p>Contains the individual module tests. This contains usage code of the methods 
  in each Com interface.<br>
  In general, the examples directory contains more useful example usage, but if 
  a method is not used in any example, the module test provides at least a minimal 
  usage example.</p>
<h4>test/com/CreateSequence</h4>
<p>Contains tests of the sequence and composition mob</p>
<h4>test/com/EssenceAccess</h4>
<p>Contains test of the EssenceAccess interfaces Utilities aafOMF conversion utility.

<HR>
<P> Why does it say "This project has no CVS history." for AAF. I thought that 
  you checked in all of the RC1 files with their revision history ?</P>
The AAF CVS repository on SourceForge does indeed contain a revision history for 
each file. The message is referring to the file /cvsroot/aaf/CVSROOT/history which, 
if present, records a history of repository activity (as opposed to activity relating 
to a particular file within the repository). It appears that repository history 
is disabled for most if not all projects on SourceForge since many display the 
message "This project has no CVS history."

Neither, the OMFI library is only used by the AAf/OMF converter utility. 
<P> What's the absolute minumum what the user has to have in order to build/run 
  an application that uses AAF ?</P>
Look at the makefile and or projects for one of the example programs. I've a feeling 
that this question wouldn't be asked if ready-built SDKs were made available on 
SourceForge. To see what went onto previous SDKs look at the installers for older 
versions of the SDK which should still be availabel on the AAF Associatiuon ftp 
site. 
<P> How did you import the binary files for the Mac files to CVS with resource 
  forks ?</P>
<p>How are they encoded ?</p>
I created the entire AAF CVS tree for all platforms on Linux using files exported 
from our ClearCase configuration management system (the export process ran on 
SGI Irix). ClearCase (plus Xinet and some Avid extensions) stores, in addition 
to the data fork, the resource fork and finder information for Macintosh files. 
Macintosh CVS clients all recognize some form of encoding for binary files they 
check in or out of CVS. Since most Macintosh CVS clients seemed to support AppleSingle, 
that's the way I encodeed the files (on Unix using the karc utility from Xinet) 
before adding them to CVS. 
<P> Did you get MacCVS to work for SSH ?</P>
<!--No. I've successfully used anonymous CVS access from Windows, Linux and Macintosh 
but I've only used ssh access from Linux.<br>
 -->There is a workable solution using MacCVSpro and MacSSH set for port forwarding 
see our <a href="http://aaf.sourceforge.net/sshMacOS.html">CVS/SSH Mac</a> page. 
<P> I'm having problems with text file line endings using MacCVS on OSX, what's 
  going on ?</P>
OSX is a Unix-like operating system and expects Unix style line endings. MacCVS 
is a client for MacOS and obeys the Macintosh line ending convention when checking 
text files out from CVS. When checking out files to OSX try the "cvs(1)" command 
line program. 
<P> AAF won't build on Red Hat Linux version 7.0 (gcc 2.1.92), I get errors in 
  /usr/include/_G_config.h, what's going on ?</P>
<p>What versions of Linux and gcc does AAF build with ?</p>
<a name="#glib_problems"></a>We have previously (for RC1) tried Red Hat Linux 
6.0 and 6.1. I recently (post RC1) tried version 7.1 (gcc 2.96) There's a bug 
in in _G_config.h which does #include(a standard header) to get a definition of 
__mbstate_t (an implementation specific typedef).<br>
Implementation specific typedefs should be obtained from implementation specific 
header files not from public header files like wchar.h.<br>
Because there is ss-impl/ref/h/wchar.h the definition of __mbstate_t is not found.<br>
I have worked around this problem by changing the makefiles and the #include directive 
for the structured storage reference implementation - these changes are checked 
in (post RC1) to CVS on SourceForge. 
<hr>
<p>Was dodo written specifically for AAF or is it in-house an Avid tool ?Specifically 
  for AAF. It was originally intended to be thrown away, hence the name, the "dodo" 
  is an extinct flightless bird. </p>
<P> How would you describe "dodo" ?</P>
It' a macro processor. 
<p>
What is/was the the <i>intended</i> way to EXTEND an interface using dodo ?
<br>
(and I mean that in the proper legal  COM sense of course)
</p>
Before answering the dodo question let's make sure we have the terminology and
rules straight.
<br.
You cannot extend individual interfaces you can however extend the API by adding
new interfaces. You may not remove or change existing interfaces, this is in
order to maintain compatibility of older applications with newer libraries. When
a new interface is added it gets a new IID, only the new applications know that
they can successfully QueryInterface() for that new IID.

<p>Do new interfaces respond to both the new and
the old UUIDs</p>

No. It would break binary compatibility to get the new interface in response to
a QI() for the old one.
<br>
Typically new interfaces are interfaces to new functionality, However, there's a
common special case of adding a new interface to existing functionality.
<br>
Let's say I have (in no particular syntax)<br>
<br>
interface foo {<br>
  method a();<br>
  method b();<br>
  .. lots of methods ...<br>
  method p();<br>
  method q();<br>
}<br>
<br>
But I wish there was also an r() method. I could address this by adding the
following new interface<br>
<br>
interface foo1 {<br>
  method r(); // only<br>
}<br>
<br>
foo1 has a different IID than foo.<br>
<br>
However new clients would have to use both foo and foo1. Another way I could
address this would be to add the following new interface
<br>
interface fooEx {<br>
  method a();<br>
  method b();<br>
  .. lots of methods ...<br>
  method p();<br>
  method q();<br>
  method r();<br>
}<br>
<br>
fooEx has the same methods as foo except with the addition of r(). This way new
clients can ignore foo and only use fooEx. Note that, just as for foo1, fooEx
has a different IID than foo. For the convenience of new clients we've repeated
all the methods of foo (at least the ones we didn't want to "change") in fooEx.
<br>
Now since foo and fooEx are very similar interfaces we can (and probably should
in AAF) have foo and fooEx share the same implementation. Note that this is an
issue for implementors, not for clients, and is a different concept than having
"the new interface respond to both the new and the old UUIDs".
<br>
For an example of how this is done in AAF see "interface
IAAFTypeDefVariableArray" and "interface IAAFTypeDefVariableArrayEx".
<br>
The naming convention seems to be foo fooEx fooEx1 ...

<p>is dodo capable of generating interfaces that share common implementation ?</p>

You make fooEx.dod by copying foo.dod, giving it a new IID, and modifying it. If
you want to share implementations, dodo knows, if you tell it, how to have an
implementation support more than one interface, again see
IAAFTypeDefVariableArray and IAAFTypeDefVariableArrayEx.
<br>
dodo also knows how to have the same interface supported by more that one
implementation, see IAAFEndian.

<P> What's the deal with Unicode and wchar_t ?</P>
<p>What are the portability issues ?</p>
The ANSI/ISO C way to support Unicode is via wchar_t (from <b>&lt;stddef.h</b>&gt;), 
nearly all compilers support wchar_t. More problematic are the wcs functions (from 
<b>&lt;wchar.h&gt;</b>) since this was a late addition to ISO some compilers may 
not support all the wcs function or they may have them in different header files.<br>
The AAF policy is that all strings/characters in memory and across the API are 
wchar_t (the size of which varies across platforms) and all strings/characters 
in AAF files are 2-byte unicode. Any transformation to from the in memory wchar_t 
to the 2-byte external form is done transparently to the API client. 
<p>What are the UNICODE and _UNICODE preprocessor symbols for ? </p>
<p>What's the difference ?</p>
These symbols are Microsoft specific (you'll encounter them on non-Microsoft platforms 
because AAF uses Microsoft Structured storage on all platforms). Defining them 
alters the prototypes (at compile time) of functions in a couple of APIs to point 
to the Unicode versions of various functions. The symbol UNICODE is for the Win32 
API and the symbol _UNICODE is for the the C run time API. The symbols work something 
like this ... Given (say in the W32) API void Foo(TCHAR* bar); with UNICODE not 
defined this maps to void Foo(char* bar); with UNICODE defined this maps to void 
FooW(wchar_t* bar); Of course this is confusing and pollutes the name space. For 
example try debugging ImplAAFEssenceAccess and you see that the CreateFile member 
ends up as CreateFileW, bah !

<p> Is there a way to receive a more meaningful HRESULT when attempting to erroneously 
  create an aaf file that already exists ?</p>
If I try this, the HRESULT I get from <b>AAFFileOpenNewModify</b>() is AAFRESULT_ASSERTION_VIOLATION.<br>
However the call to <b>AAFFileOpenNewModify</b>() resulted in a call to StgCreateDocfile() 
which did return a meaningful HRESULT (0x80030050, already exists) indicating 
that the file already exists.Unfortunately there is currently no way to receive 
a more meaningful HRESULT when attempting to erroneously create an .AAF file that 
already exists.<br>
We planned to provide complete error handling in the Object Manager but that work 
has not yet been done. This work was deferred to concentrate on work items of 
higher priority.Currently the HRESULT returned by StgCreateDocfile() is lost. 
I suggest the following <i>workaround</i> - Use the host file system [ansi - <b>fopen</b>(), 
W32 - <b>CreateFile</b>() etc.] to check that the file does not already exist 
prior to calling <b>AAFFileOpenNewModify</b>()<br>
If you have a GUI you probably want to report the error that the file already 
exists when the user _chooses_ the name of the file to create i.e. before calling 
<b>AAFFileOpenNewModify</b>(). Alternatively you could try calling the W32 API 
function GetLastError() Other workarounds involving the use of <b>AAFCreateAAFFileOnRawStorage</b>() 
[available in RC1] may be possible. <br>
Note that the goal is for AAF to support multiple external representations. In 
addition to structured storage binary files, support for XML (text) and SMPTE 
KLV (binary) encodings is possible.<br>
This means that calls to <b>AFFileOpenNewModify</b>() don't always result in a 
call to <b>StgCreateDocfile</b>(). For each external representation the function 
called by the Object Manager to open/create the file is different and may not 
even return an HRESULT [e.g. fopen()]<br>
Any error handling scheme that is eventually implemented in the Object Manager 
needs to take the support for multiple external representations into account while 
still preserving any HRESULT that may be available.

<p>When I try to build the AAF reference implementation on Windows 98 everything 
  works fine until I reach the <b>win32aafsdk.mak</b> step. Exactly one command 
  seems to be echoed, but doesn't get executed, then everything hangs. <br>
  After a fresh checkout out that one command is "md" to make a directory. If 
  I make the directories by hand the command that hangs is the first "copy". If 
  I do the first copy by hand then it hangs on the next copy command and so on. 
  When a hang occurs I can't stop the build with the button in the tool bar. I 
  have to kill "vcspawn" with the task manager. After doing this a couple of times 
  the system becomes unusable and I can't shut it down cleanly. What's going wrong 
  ?</p>
Disable all anti-virus software. There are two different win api calls for spawning, 
and one of them gets intercepted by Norton Anitvirus (and I've also seen the same 
report for MacAfee). This problem was confirmed with Windows 98 and Norton Anti-Virus.

<p>How do I get Visual Studio to prompt me with AAF class and interface information 
  ? </p>
In order to use the AAF class and interface information in Visual Studio (which 
is not automatically built in the project files on SourceForge).<br>
You will need to enable the generation of .SBR files when the AAF project is built, 
then concatenate all these files together using the <b>bscmake</b> tool from a 
command line<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.</font><br>
<br>
With the top level AAFWinSDK workspace open, select Project-&gt;Settings...<br>
Select the C/C++ tab and highlight the projects you want to generate Browse info 
for on the left (most of the ones that start AAF...).<br>
Then check the <b>Generate Browse info box</b> and hit OK.<br>
The .SBR files during the build you can be combined with the <b>bscmake</b> command.<br>
From the command line call bscmake with list of all the sbr files.In a <b>bash</b> 
shell this is something like:<br>
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><br>
cd AAF/AAFWinSDK/ref-impl<br>
bscmake /o mydata.bsc */Debug/*.sbr</font><br>
<br>
Then open the mydata.bsc file in visual studio. By highlighting a member function 
you will be now have the option to see it's parameters or jump to the definition.<br>
Be careful not to check these modified project files back in to sourceforge.

<p>I'm having problems getting CVS to work, is there any way to view individual 
  source files ?</p>
Yes, the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/aaf/AAF/">CVS 
browse interface</a> on SourceForge allows you to download individual files as 
well as viewing the differences between versions. 
<hr>
<p>The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) doesn't seem to be used anywhere in 
  the current AAF implementation.<br>
  Is this a deliberate policy? if so, why? </p>
It is a deliberate policy. It was done for portability (i.e. portability between 
different implementations) and to eliminate an extra dependency. At the time we 
started AAF development (early 1998) the STL implementations in our first three 
compilers (VC++ 5.0, or was it 4.0?, CodeWarrior 3, and the SGI C++ compiler [GNU 
C++ was not on the list at that time]) were very inconsistent and patchy. The 
STL implementations have improved since then, I'm using the STL on another project 
where portability is less of a concern, but I still have to refer frequently to 
"Effective STL" by Scott Meyers. I'd recommend sticking to this policy for the 
AAF reference implementation. <br>
<br>
The only appearence of &lt;iostream&gt; is in the Object Manager code for debug, 
and it's very easy to turn it off (see <a href="#OMdebug">OMdebug</a> above ).

<p>I ran one of the example programs that are distributed with the AAF toolkit 
  and created an example AAF file.<br>
  When I try to import the file into &lt;product x&gt; it doesn't work, why not ?</p>

While those example programs do create AAF files they certainly do not create 
AAF files with the correct contents such that they can successfully be imported 
by &lt;product x&gt;. An AAF file can be thought of as a container. Having the correct 
container is is not sufficient, one must also have the correct contents for the 
file to be acceptable to the consumer. The AAF Association is aware of this issue 
and is working on a solution variously known as "Templates" or "Operational Patterns".
