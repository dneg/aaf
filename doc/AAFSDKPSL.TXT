This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if 
You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this Agreement under this Section 6.1 shall survive. Any license granted by you 
to any Contributor, the Standards Body or any Adopter of AAF, and any end user license 
agreement for Larger Works containing or linking to the AAF SDK in Executable form that 
have been validly granted by You hereunder prior to termination shall continue in full force 
and shall extend to entities who become Adopters of AAF (and their customers provided in 
the license) even after such termination.

an Adopter under the terms set forth in the Withdrawal provisions in the Adopter's Agreement 
in Exhibit B. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of 
this Agreement under this Section 6.2 shall survive.

Contributor, the Standards Body or any Adopter of AAF, and any end user license 
agreement for Larger Works containing or linking to the AAF SDK in Executable form that 
have been validly granted by You hereunder prior to Your withdrawal shall continue in full 
force and shall extend to entities who become Adopters of AAF (and their customers 
provided in the license) even after such withdrawal. The license to you under Sections 2.2 
and 2.3 shall survive after the date of such withdrawal. No license shall be deemed granted 
or received by You less than 60 days prior to or after the date of such withdrawal.

6.3 By Cessation of Control of Affiliates.
In the event that control of an Affiliate ceases to exist, 
such Affiliate will be deemed to have withdrawn pursuant to the terms set forth in the 
Withdrawal provisions in the Adopter's Agreement in Exhibit B, resulting in termination of this 
Agreement under Section 6.2 above. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE TO ANY

RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED PROFITS, IN ANY 
WAY RELATED TO USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE AAF SDK, OR OTHERWISE IN 
CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE CONTRIBUTOR HAS 
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY 
FOR LACK OF SATISFACTION WITH THE AAF SDK IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE AAF SDK. 
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND 
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

complete and exclusive agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. The Exhibits identified in 
this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. If any provision of this 
Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason in a jurisdiction, such provision shall be 
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such holding shall not affect the

_ "Adopter" is the entity named at the end of this Agreement. 
_ "Fellow Adopters" are the Promoters and any other entity which executes a copy of this 
Agreement and delivers it to one of the Promoters. 
_ "Affiliate" is an entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common 
control with another entity, so long as such control exists. In the event such control ceases to 
exist, such Affiliate will be deemed to have withdrawn pursuant to the terms set forth in the 
Withdrawal provisions below. "Control" means beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent 
of the voting stock or equity in an entity. 
_ "Specification" is the specification entitled Advanced Authoring Format ("AAF") authored, 
adopted, and published by the Promoters, including any Updates thereto. 
_ "Update(s)" means any new updates, revisions, versions or extensions of the Specification 
issued and adopted and published by the Promoters. 
_ "Licensee's Product(s)" means a product that implements and complies with the relevant 
portions of the Specification and any Updates as set forth in the Test Suites. 
_ "Test Suites" means that portion of the Specification or Updates that list the requirements for 
Licensee's Products to be considered compliant with the Specification or Updates. 
The following terms and conditions will become effective and are contingent upon receipt by a 
Promoter of a copy of this Agreement signed by an authorized representative of Adopter:
Licenses:
_ Grants of Licenses. The following license has been granted by the Promoters to each other 
under the terms of the Advanced Authoring Format Promotersâ Agreement (copy of which to 
be attached to the executed copy of this Agreement). Upon Adopterâs execution of this 
Agreement, it is granted by Adopter to all Fellow Adopters, and the grants of all Fellow 
Adopters shall extend to Adopter. In each case, the party (Promoter, Adopter, or Fellow 
Adopter) granting the covenant is referred to as the "Licensor". 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement Adopter and its Affiliates grants to 
each Fellow Adopter and its Affiliates (together "Licensee"), under any claim of a patent or 
patent application otherwise infringed directly or indirectly (contributorily or by inducement) 
and owned by the Adopter or its Affiliates, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, 
world-wide license (without rights to sublicense except as part of the transfer of a 
Licenseeâs Product to allow use of such product by an end-user) to make, have made, use, 
sell, offer to sell, license, and import Licenseeâs products, where infringement of such 
claims would not have occurred but for implementation of and compliance with the relevant 
portions of such Specification and Updates. Such license is contingent on the Licenseeâs 
Product fully complying with a version of the Specification and Updates as determined by 
passing the Test Suites to the extent required for such a product.
_ Copyright License. This Agreement also includes a personal, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-
transferable, world-wide, limited license from Promoters to Adopter to use, copy, modify and 
distribute any copyrighted material in the Specification and Updates only for the purpose of 
implementing the AAF Specification and Updates to the extent necessary to create a 
Licenseeâs Product . Adopter acknowledges and agrees that Adopter has no right to use or 
distribute such copyrighted material separate from Licenseeâs Product. 
Withdrawal
_ Adopter may withdraw at any time by providing written notice to the Promoters. The effect of 
such withdrawal is that all licenses granted by a withdrawing Adopter and its Affiliates with 
respect to the Specification and Updates adopted and published by the Promoters more than 
60 days prior to the date of withdrawal shall continue in full force and shall extend to entities 
who become Adopters (and their Affiliates and customers as provided in the license) even 
after such withdrawal. Further, the licenses granted to such Adopter and its Affiliates shall 
continue to apply with respect to the Specification and any Updates adopted and published 
by the Promoters more than 60 days prior to the date of withdrawal. No license shall be 
deemed granted or received by such Adopter and its Affiliates as to Updates adopted and 
published less than 60 days prior to or after the date of such withdrawal. 
_ For compatibility purposes, it is intended that once a particular technology is included in a 
licensed Specification or Update, if that technology would infringe a particular patent claim 
but for the rights granted under this Agreement, Promoters and Adopters will be able to 
continue to use that same technology as set out in the Specification or Update in all future 
Updates. Thus, a technology that has been licensed by the withdrawing Adopter and 
included in the Specification or an Update adopted more than 60 days prior to the date of 
withdrawal of such Adopter, such technology shall continue to be licensed in Updates 
adopted after the withdrawal to the extent the same patent claims would apply to the 
technology before the withdrawal as after the withdrawal. 
General
_ No Other Licenses. Adopter neither grants nor receives any license to or right to use any 
trademark, trade name, or maskwork hereunder. Except for the rights expressly provided by 
this Agreement, Adopter neither grants nor receives, by implication, or estoppel, or otherwise, 
any rights under any patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights.

this Agreement and grant the licenses set forth herein. In addition, Adopter acknowledges

WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY 
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR ANY 
PARTICULAR OR INTENDED PURPOSE, OR ANY WARRANTY OTHERWISE ARISING OUT 
OF ANY PROPOSAL, SPECIFICATION, UPDATE, OR SAMPLE. 
_ Damages. In no event will Promoters, Adopter or Fellow Adopters be liable to the other for 
any loss of profits, loss of use, incidental, consequential, indirect, or special damages arising 
out of this Agreement, whether or not such party had advance notice of the possibility of 
such damages.
