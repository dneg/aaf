other rights in the AAF SDK, and b) You neither grant nor receive, by
implication, estoppel or otherwise, any rights to any patents,
copyrights or other intellectual property rights.

3. Distribution Requirements

3.1. Delivery of Source Code to Standards Body.  You agree to deliver
to the Standards Body Your Modifications and/or Your Contributor
Version in Source Code form within sixty (60) days after You first
distribute any AAF SDK (or portion thereof) with Your Modifications
under Section 2.2 above. If Your Modifications and/or Your Contributor
Version do not comply with all requirements of the Standard and all
other requirements set out by the Standards Body, You must also
deliver to the Standards Body a description of any deviation from the
Standard resulting from Your Modifications.

3.2. Grant Back of Your Modifications to the Standards Body.  Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Standards Body a worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to Your
Contributor Version and Modifications, in whole and in part, and with
and without additional Modifications, in the same scope and for the
same purposes as the licenses granted to You in Sections 2.1, 2.2, and
2.3 above. Without limiting Your right to reproduce and distribute
Your Contributor Version, the Standards Body may choose in its sole
discretion to designate your Contributor Version a Standard Version of
the AAF SDK, and/or may use any part of your Contributor Version, with
or without other Modifications, to create and designate a Standard
Version of the AAF SDK.  You understand and agree that the Standards
Body holds and will hold the copyright to all Standard Versions of the
AAF SDK, and You hereby assign all rights necessary to effect this to

3.3 Required Notice in Source Code.  The Source Code for the AAF SDK
(or portion thereof), with or without Modifications, may be
distributed only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must
include a copy of this Agreement with every copy of the AAF SDK (or
portion thereof) that You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
terms on any version of the AAF SDK (or portion thereof) that alters
or restricts the applicable version of this Agreement or the
recipients' rights hereunder. Your license for shipment of the AAF SDK
(or portion thereof) with or without modifications is conditioned upon
Your full compliance with this Section 3.  You must duplicate or
retain the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code for the
AAF SDK. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such
notice in a file called "LEGAL" in a location (such as a relevant
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If
You create Original Code to be distributed under this Agreement, You
may insert the notice in Exhibit A into the Source Code file for that
Original Code, and insert Your Name as the Initial Developer.  If You
created one or more Modification(s) You may add Your name as a
Contributor to such a notice in any file containing such
Modification(s).  If Your Contributor Version and/or Your
Modifications do not comply with all requirements of the Standard and
all other requirements set out by the Standards Body that are in
effect sixty (60) days before distribution, You must provide a
description with Your Contributor Version and/or Your Modifications of
any deviation from the Standard resulting from Your Modifications;
and, unless Your Contributor Version has been designated a Standard
Version of the AAF SDK, you must prominently state that it is not a
standard version. All Standard Versions of the AAF SDK must be so
labeled.

 3.4 Required Notice for Larger Works.  You must duplicate this
Agreement in any documentation for a Larger Work.  You must include a
notice stating that the Source Code version of the AAF SDK used in the
Larger Work is available from You and/or the Standards Body under the
terms of this Agreement. The notice and this Agreement must be
conspicuously included in the Larger Work, related documentation or
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights or ownership
rights relating to the AAF SDK.

 3.5 Licenses Granted by You for Larger Works.  You may distribute a
Larger Work under Section 2.2 under a license of Your choice, which
may contain terms different from this Agreement, provided that You are
in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If You distribute the
Larger Work under a different license, then You must make it
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this Agreement are
offered by You alone, not by any Contributor. You hereby agree to
indemnify each Contributor for any liability incurred by the
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.  You may choose
to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of a Larger
Work. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any
such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered
by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify other Contributors for
any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

4. Application of this Agreement.  This Agreement applies to code to
which a Contributor has attached the notice in Exhibit A.

THIRD PARTY'S RIGHTS, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET POSSESSION,

VIRUSES, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OR RESPONSES, RESULTS OR
PERFORMANCE.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EACH CONTRIBUTOR AND THE
STANDARDS BODY HEREBY DISCLAIM ANY (IF ANY) WARRANTY (A) REGARDING THE
ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE AAF SDK, AND (B) THAT THE AAF SDK IS
APPROPRIATE FOR ANY PARTICULAR USE OR THAT USE OF THE AAF SDK WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE USE, QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE AAF SDK IS WITH YOU.  THIS DISCLAIMER IS AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.  NO DISTRIBUTION OF THE AAF SDK,
SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING ANY STANDARD VERSIONS OF THE AAF SDK, IS
AUTHORIZED EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. Termination.

6.1.  This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination
of this Agreement under this Section 6.1 shall survive.  Any license
granted by you to any Contributor or the Standards Body, and any end
user license agreement for Larger Works containing or linking to the
AAF SDK in Executable form that have been validly granted by You
hereunder prior to termination shall continue in full force even after
such termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR AND/OR
THE STANDARDS BODY BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, GENERAL, ECONOMIC, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS
OF GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING
FROM LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED PROFITS, IN ANY
WAY RELATED TO USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE AAF SDK, OR OTHERWISE IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE
CONTRIBUTOR AND/OR THE STANDARDS BODY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR LACK OF
SATISFACTION WITH THE AAF SDK IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE AAF
SDK. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. Government End Users.  U.S. Government: If the AAF SDK is
being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a
U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then

shall be only as set forth in this agreement; this is in accordance
with 48 C.F.R. 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense
(DoD) acquisitions) and with 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DoD
acquisitions).

9. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall constitute the complete and
exclusive agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. The Exhibit
identified in this Agreement is incorporated herein by reference and
made a part hereof.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable for any reason in a jurisdiction, such provision shall
be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and
such holding shall not affect the enforceability of such provision
under other circumstances or in other jurisdictions, or of the
remaining provisions hereof under all circumstances. None of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by
any act or acquiescence on the part of any Contributor and/or the
Standards Body, their agents or employees, but only by an instrument
in writing signed by them. With respect to disputes in which at least
one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal
Courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with the losing party
responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not apply to this License.
