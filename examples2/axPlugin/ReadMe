Title:	AxPlugin Readme - How to reuse the AxPlugin (null codec) code.

Revision History:  18 Oct 2002, Jim Trainor, Initial Revision

This is a simple example AAF plugin implementation.  Please refer to
the AxPlug.pdf file for an overview (in UML format) of the code.  The
AxPlugin code satisfies the basic requirements of all AFF plugins:

Another reference is the "AAF Plugins and Codecs" presentation given
at the AAF Engineering Commitee Meeting in Atlanta on Oct 7'th, 2002.

i) A simple means to register all the components implemented by the
plugin.

ii) A common class factory to create these components.

iii) A shared IUnknown implementation that support COM object
aggregation (note, the factory is also involved in aggregation
support).

iv) Implementation of the four static entry points that must exist in
all AAF plugins (see the AxPluginEntryPoints.cpp file).

Support for COM aggregregation is provided using the techniques
presented in the book: "Inside COM", Dale Rogerson, Microsoft Press.
This book is the basis for the CAxUnknown implementation, and
CAxClassFactory::CreateInstance() implementation.

The four items noted above are implemented in a fairly transparent
style that should be easy to understand and reuse.  In general, all
that is required in order to reuse this code to copy all the files to
a new location and add a new file(s) containing the implementation of
your COM object.  Your COM object should be implemented using
CAxNullEssenceCodec.{cpp,h} as a guide.

If the idea of copying and modifying the code is offensive, the AxPlug
build can be easily modified to create a static library than can be
linked into a COM plugin implementation.

Here is a recipe to get started with a new plugin:

1) Copy the entire directory somewhere.  Search and replace the prefix
"Ax" with a class prefix of you choosing.

2) Create two new files: CMyPlugin.h and CMyPlugin.cpp

3) CMyPlugin.h should include CAxUnknown.h and AAFPlugin.h.

4) Define you new COM object in CMyPlugin.h.  The example below
implements the IAAFEssenceCodec interface:

 	#include "CAxUnknown.h"
	#include <AAFPlugin.h>

	class CMyPlugin {
	  : public IAAFEssenceCodec, <<= We choose to implement this plugin interface.
	    public IAAFPlugin, 	     <<= All AAF plugins must implement this.
	    public CAxUnknown        <<= Inherit the CAxUnknown IUknnown implementation
	{
	public:

		// Required constructor and destructor.
		CAxNullEssenceCodec( IUnknown * pUnkOuter );
		~CAxNullEssenceCodec();

		// Use this macro the implement the IUnknown methods.
		// This macro inserts code that uses CAxUnknown to 
		// implement QueryInterface(), AddRef(), and Release().
		// The CAxUnknown implementation takes care of aggregation
		// issues.		
		CAXUNKNOWN_DECLARE_IUNKNOWN_METHODS
	
		// Override CAxUnknown::NondelegatingQueryInterface() in order to
		// add support for the interfaces implemented by this class.
		// Please refer to the "Inside COM" book to understand why this
		// is called "NondelegatingQueryInterface" rather than simply
		// "QueryInterface".

		STDMETHOD( NondelegatingQueryInterface(const IID& iid, void** ppv) );

		//
		// IAAFPlugin Interface
		//

		.... declare the IAAFPlugin methods

		//
		// IAAFEssenceCodec interface methods
		//

		.... declare the IAAFEssenceCodecs methods

	};

5) Add the CMyPlugin method definitions to CMyPlugin.cpp:
	
	#include "CMyPlugin.h"

	CMyPlugin::CMyPlugin( IUnknown* pUnkOuter )
	:  CAxUnknown( pUnkOuter )
	{}

	CMyPlugin::~CMyPlugin()
	{}

	HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE CMyPlugin::NondelegatingQueryInterface(const IID& iid, void** ppv)
	{
		// CMyPlugin implements IID_IAAFPlugin...
		if ( IID_IAAFPlugin == iid ) {
			// FinishQI is part of CAxUnkown... there is nothing special there.
			// Tt just takes care of incrementing the ref count.
			return FinishQI( static_cast<IAAFPlugin*>(this), ppv );
		}

		// CMyPlugin also implements IID_IAAFEssenceCodec...
		else if ( IID_IAAFEssenceCodec == iid ) {
			return FinishQI( static_cast<IAAFEssenceCodec*>(this), ppv );
		}	

		// Check for any additional interfaces this object implements

		// Delegate unknown interface ids to CAxUnkown.

		// IMPORTANT - Call NondelegateQueryInterface() NOT QueryInterface()!
		// This is required because a call to QueryInterface is delegated
		// back to the object in which we may be aggregated.... we don't
		// want that to happen.

		else {
			return CAxUnknown::NondelegatingQueryInterface( iid, ppv );
		}
	}

6) This new COM object implementation needs to be registered, and a
class factory must exist.  Both are acheived by simply registering an
instance AxPluginFctry<CMyPlugin>.  This is easily accomplished in the
constructor of a static global object defined in your anonymous
namespace.  At this point, a class id (CLSID) is required.  The
uuidgen.exe program supplied with Microsoft Visual C++ is a conveniet
way to generate a unique identifier.

  Add the following to CMyPlugin.cpp:

#include <memory>

namespace{ 

// Use Microsoft's uuidgen.exe program to generate a CLSID
// aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-ddee-ffgghhiijjkk
const CLSID CLSID_CMyPlugin =
{ 0xaaaaaaaa, 0xbbbb, 0xcccc, { 0xdd, 0xee, 0xff, 0xgg, 0xhh, 0xii, 0xjj, 0xkk } };

class RegisterMyPlugin
{
public:

	RegisterMyPlugin()
	{
		std::auto_ptr<AxPluginFctryPrtcl> myPluginCodecFctry(
			new AxPluginFctry<CMyPlugin>( CLSID_CMyPlugin ) );

		AxPluginRegistry::GetInstance().AddFactory( myPluginCodecFctry );
	}

	~RegisterMyPlugin()
	{
		AxPluginRegistry::GetInstance().RemoveFactory( CLSID_CMyPlugin );
	}
};

RegisterMyPlugin nullEssenceCodecRegister;

}
7) Link my CMyCodec.o in with the rest of the AxPlugin code to create
a new library.  That's it.  There is no need to modify the CAxPlugin
code, just link in your new code.

8) Implement the IAAFPlugin and IAAFEssenceCodec (or what ever
inteface you are implementing).  This is the hard part.

9) If, for some reason, you need to add some platform specific code
(i.e. a DllMain implementation for a Windows dll), this can be done by
adding code to the AxPluginWin.cpp file.  For Unix and MacOS platforms
use the like named file.  Currently, there is no need for any platform
specific code.

10) The axPluginInfo program is a simple way to test loading your
plugin.  It will load the plugin and log a bit of informatin about all
plugins registered with the AAF SDK.
