Major Changes from v1.1.1 to v1.1.2
-----------------------------------

New stored format support:
  AAF-KLV (create file with file kind = kAAFFileKind_AafKlvBinary)
  AAF-XML (create file with file kind = kAAFFileKind_AafXmlText)

See "AAF-KLV implementation issues" for more details.

The AAF-XML support is fully functional, however it should be regarded
as experimental, pending the completion of SMPTE standardisation of the
XML schema as SMPTE 2001 Reg-XML. When standardisation is complete, the
implementation in the AAF toolkit will be updated to match the published
SMPTE specification.

Extended APIs:
  IAAFAES3PCMDescriptor2, IAAFEssenceData2, IAAFEssenceDescriptor2,
  IAAFEventMobSlot2, IAAFFileDescriptor2,  IAAFTypeDefStreamEx,
  IAAFTypeDefStream3

New APIs:
  IAAFAES3PCMDescriptor, IAAFBWFImportDecriptor, IAAFCachePageAllocator,
  IAAFDataEssenceDescriptor, IAAFDescriptiveClip, IAAFDescriptiveObject,
  IAAFDiagnosticOutput, IAAFFileEncoding, IAAFKLVEssenceDataParameters,
  IAAFKLVStreamParameters, IAAFMPEGVideoDescriptor,
  IAAFMultipleDescriptor, IAAFPlainEssenceData, IAAFPlainStreamData,
  IAAFProgress, IAAFRIFFChunk, IAAFStreamAccess, IAAFSubDescriptor,
  EnumAAFFileDescriptors, EnumAAFFileEncodings, EnumAAFRIFFChunks,
  EnumAAFSubDescriptors

  see http://aaf.sourceforge.net/docs/aafapiman/

New built-in stored object class definitions:
  AES3PCMDescriptor, BWFImportDescriptor, DataEssenceDescriptor,
  DescriptiveClip, DescriptiveObject, MPEGVideoDescriptor,
  MultipleDescriptor, RIFFChunk, SubDescriptor

New built-in stored object property definitions:
  AES3PCMDescriptor::
    AuxBitsMode, BlockStartOffset, ChannelStatusMode, Emphasis,
    FixedChannelStatusData, FixedUserData, UserDataMode
  BWFImportDescriptor::
    BextCodingHistory, QltyBasicData, QltyCueSheet, QltyEndOfModulation,
    QltyFileSecurityReport, QltyFileSecurityWave, QltyOperatorComment,
    QltyQualityEvent, QltyQualityParameter, QltyStartOfModulation,
    UnknownBWFChunks
  DataEssenceDescriptor::DataEssenceCoding
  DescriptiveClip::SourceTrackIDs
  EssenceDescriptor::SubDescriptors
  EventMobSlot::EventSlotOrigin
  FileDescriptor::LinkedSlotID
  MPEGVideoDescriptor::
    BitRate, ClosedGOP, CodedContentScanning, ConstantBPictureCount, 
    IdenticalGOP, LowDelay, MaxBPictureCount, MaxGOP, ProfileAndLevel,
    SingleSequence
  MultipleDescriptor::FileDescriptors
  RIFFChunk::
    ChunkData, ChunkID, ChunkLength

Revise AAFMetaDict.xls to track SMPTE metadata registers
  Build-in agreed list of DefinitionObject Instances
    (ContainerDefinitions and DataDefinition).
  Extend headergen to create built-in Dictionary DefinitionObject
    Instances.

New stream access APIs:
  IAAFPlainStreamData and IAAFPlainEssenceData provide access to the
  value of the stream, independent of the stored format. For AAF-KLV,
  the existing AAF stream interfaces provide access to the entire MXF
  stream (that is, all KLVs in the stream including any trailing KLV
  Fill). See CAAFPlainStreamDataTest and CAAFPlainEssenceDataTest module
  tests for examples.

Plugin Codec changes:
  Updated JPEG codec to enhance compatibility with Avid products

New Examples:
  ExportJPEG, ImportJPEG
  Updates and additions to AxLib

New Utilities:
  aaffmtconv - Convert between structured storage and XML stored formats
  AAFAnalyzer - AAF file compliance analyzer tool (under development)
  MXFDump - Dump MXF files in excruciating detail

Enhanced Tests:
  - Add encoding switch to OpenExistingModify test
  - Add test of IAAFTypeDefVariableArray::GetElements() for arrays of
    non-objects (scalars)
  - Add MetaModelVerification to MakeSDKExamples project where COM tests reside
  - Changes to TypeDefRecord module test to test v1.1.1 behaviour
  - Refactor TypeDefRecord module test to separate GetValue() and
    GetStruct() type calls to improve level of testing across different
    storage formats
  - Fix WAVEDescriptor & AIFCDescriptor module tests to handle foreign
    endian files
  - Include additional tests in "make check"
  - Use known OperationCategoryType in module tests so InfoDumper &
    ComPropDirectDump dump OK
  - Change ComPropDirectDump/dumper to not exit when dumping ExtEnum
    properties with non-existant names
  - Addition of nightly build and test script which generates static web page
    results

Other Enhancements:
  - Improve methods used to register structured storage OMStoredObjectFactory
    implementations, and to declare the default for each encoding type. Restore
    Schemasoft implementation as default on Windows.
  - Refactor kAAFSignature_* from AAFFileKinds.h to ImplAAFFile.cpp to address
    bug on MacOS 10.4.9 gcc 4.0.1 in which kAAFSignature_Aaf512Binary was not
    correctly statically initialised before user code was executed.

Build Options:
  - Saving of Object Directory is now optional (compiler option
    OM_SAVEOBJECTDIRECTORY). On reading, Object Direcory is no longer
    required to be present.
  - Root object class ID can now be written as a SMPTE UL or as the
    legacy UUID (compiler option OM_WRITELEGACYROOTCLASSID). Both
    values are recognised when reading. Default is to use legacy
    UUID value, for backwards compatibility.

Portability:
  - MacOS X on Intel support added (i386Darwin AAF platform)
  - Removed requirement to have a structured storage library built
    into AAF library (make AAF_NO_STRUCTURED_STORAGE=1)
  - Byte order (little endian/big endian) is determined at run time not compile
    time
  - Initial support for g++ on WIN32 enabling MinGW apps to link to AAF
    static libs. AAFCOAPI.dll library must still be built with MSVC.
    Refactor makefiles to enable make driven MSVC++ build
  - Additional compiler warning clean-up:
    Fix gcc 4.2.x deprecated conversion from string constant warnings.
    Fix gcc 4.3 warning for missing declarations. In gcc 4.3 the C++ header
    dependencies have been cleaned up so code cannot rely on indirect inclusion.
  - Build MXFDump on i386Darwin and SparcSolaris
  - Dependency generation for AAFPLATFORM=UniversalDarwin


Major Changes from v1.1.0 to v1.1.1
-----------------------------------

This is a bug-fix release.  The following problems in V1.1.0 are fixed with
this release:

- Writing a file containing a Set or Array of Records using V1.1.0 might
  result in a file that is unreadable.  Attempting to open such a file with a
  debug version of the SDK library will result in an assertion failure.
  Attempting to open such a file with a release version of the SDK library
  has the potential to cause a heap corruption.


- SourceForge Bug ID #1188299:
  ImplAAFSourceReference::SetChannelIDs() does not work 
  ImplAAFSourceReference::SetChannelIDs() passes its numberElements parameter
  directly to _channelIDs.copyToBuffer(), which is expecting a byte count not
  a number of elements. As a result, nothing is set if you call
  IAAFSourceReference2::SetChannelIDs() with less than 4 channel IDs, etc.

  The fix appears to be to pass (numberElements * sizeof(aafUInt32)) 
  instead of numberElements

  This also applied to IAAFSourceReference2.


- SourceForge Bug ID #1188301:
  ImplAAFSourceReference::GetChannelIDs() does not work 
  As with ImplAAFSourceReference::SetChannelIDs(),
  ImplAAFSourceReference::GetChannelIDs() passes the number of elements when
  it should be passing a byte count. Specifically, it passes numberElements to
  _channelIDs.copyToBuffer() instead of (numberElements *sizeof(aafUInt32)). 

  This also applied to IAAFSourceReference2.


- The 6 new IAAFSourceReference2 APIs were tested.


- SourceForge Bug ID #1191791:
  LastModified property of Header not set on AAFFile->Save() 
  When Save() is called on an IAAFFile object, the LastModified property on
  the Header is not updated and is written as 0000-00-00-00-00-00
  (aafTimeStamp_t).
  This occurred in version 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 of the AAF SDK. 


- Add support for powerpc64-linux platform (Apple G5, IBM Power64, etc).
  Tested using Gentoo Linux 2005.0 on Apple G5.


- Added tests for: IAAFHeader, IAAFAuxiliaryDescriptor, IAAFComponent and
  IAAFDictionary


- doxygen formatting fixes for dodo files

Removed features:
  - Support for MS VC 6 has been dropped and all .dsp/.dsw files removed

    can be downloaded from http://www.aafassociation.org/download/
  - Support for Mac OS 9 has been removed


Compatibility with earlier releases
-----------------------------------

- Files generated by the AAF v1.1.x SDK cannot be read by earlier AAF SDKs,
  due to a limitation in the metadictionary processing code of SDKs prior
  to AAF v1.1.


Notes
-----

- To create 4kB sector AAF files use any of the following interfaces.
  When embedding large amounts of essence in an AAF file (e.g. 10 minutes of
  DV material) 4kB sectors are necessary to overcome the 2GB filesize limit.
    AAFFileOpenNewModify( filename, AAF_FILE_MODE_USE_LARGE_SS_SECTORS, ...)
    AAFFileOpenNewModifyEx( filename, kAAFFileKind_Aaf4KBinary, ...)
    AAFCreateRawStorageDisk(...) followed by
      AAFCreateAAFFileOnRawStorage(..., kAAFFileKind_Aaf4KBinary, ...)


AAF KLV implementation implementation issues
--------------------------------------------

The AAF KLV implementation was developed with the goal of being a
compliant implementation of SMPTE 377M Material eXchange Format (MXF),
based on the belief that this was technically possible.

In this release, there are a few known outstanding issues.

- The AAF MetaDictionary object is written to the file on output and,
if present, read from the file on input, in order to support reliable
parsing of any extension data in the file. This facility is not a standard
part of MXF.

- In order to read typical MXF files (which do not contain a
MetaDictionary), the implementation can fall back to its built-in
definitions when reading an MXF file without a MetaDictionary.
This fails when data is encountered that is not defined by the built-in
definitions. If a property without a definition is encountered, the SDK
cannot restore the property and the file open call will fail (although
note below an exception to this in the case of Header::PrimaryMob). If
an object without a definition is encountered, the SDK skips the object
as dark. Any strong reference to the dark object will fail to resolve
and if such a strong reference property exists in a file the file
will fail to open. It fails at OMKLVStoredObject::restoreObject(const
OMStrongObjectReference&), after _storage->object(id) returns NULL. An
example of this case is DescriptiveMarker::Description, which will
typically point to a subclass of DescriptiveFramework that is not
defined in the built-in definitions.  Weak references to dark objects
will trigger a similar error.  In all these cases a client will get
AAFRESULT_UNEXPECTED_EXCEPTION returned from the toolkit file open calls.

- An AAF Root object is written to the file on output, to strong
reference the Header and MetaDictionary objects. This is not a standard
part of MXF. The implementation does not require the AAF Root object to
be present in order to find the Header object of a typical MXF file.

- Support has been added to the SDK to process WeakReference<Mob> types,
such as is used by the Header::PrimaryMob property. However, this property
has not been added to the built-in definitions because its presence would
have broken backwards-compatibility with AAF v1.1.0 or v1.1.1. At a future
time, when v1.1.2 is widely deployed, there may be a case for adding
Header::PrimaryMob to the built-in definitions. In order to read typical
MXF OP Atom files (which contain a Header::PrimaryMob property),
the implementation filters out this property so that its presence does
not trigger a run-time error caused by the lack of a definition.

- The version number (byte 8) in the KLV key of KLV Fill items is
frequently incorrect in MXF implementations. It is often v1, instead of
v2. The AAF KLV implementation outputs v1, and will accept v1 or v2 on input.

- Modification of an existing MXF file has only been tested in a
limited case. The successful test was to run the OpenExistingModify
test with default parameters. The test creates a metadata-only file,
which is then modified. The test changes values of existing properties,
adds new objects, including an object with a stream property, and saves
the file. This is not a typical workflow as
metadata-only MXF files are uncommon.

- The SDK fails to open AAF KLV files that contain extension weak reference
properties. The toolkit relies on the target path to find objects
referenced by weak reference properties.  The target paths for built-in
weak references are known but the paths for extensions are not and need
to come from the file. AAF KLV files (unlike AAF Structured Storage files)
do not store the target paths.

- MXF essence generated by an AAF codec uses a fixed default essence
element key (within the MXF essence stream) instead of the correct essence
element key as defined by the particular MXF essence mapping. The default
value used is that of the essence element node defined by the MXF Generic
Container (SMPTE 379M). The correct essence element key can be specified by
client code creating the MXF essence stream directly.

- IAAFMasterMob::AddMasterSlot creates a SourceClip contained directly by
a MobSlot, and not within a Sequence. This is not strictly valid for MXF.

- A workaround is used to deal with opening files in which a built-in
property definition is not in the file's metadictionary. The workaround is
to make the property optional by default to prevent an attempt to retrieve
the value of a property that doesn't exist in the file.


Structured Storage implementation (where applicable)
----------------------------------------------------

The AAF SDK typically requires an implementation of Structured Storage
to be provided on the platform. This may be provided as part of the
operating system, as part of an another application, as a proprietary
library or as an open source library.

For the cases where such a library is not already
available, a pre-compiled Structured Storage library is provided
(libSSRW2C.a and ssrw_c.lib) for use on the supported platforms. The
pre-compiled Structured Storage library is licensed under an agreement
between the AAF Association and a proprietary Structured Storage library
vendor:
  http://www.aafassociation.org/html/licenses/SchemaSoftTerms.pdf
  (reproduced in text form at the end of this document)

This proprietary library may be redistributed as part of the AAF SDK under
the conditions of that agreement. If you need to port this proprietary
Stuctured Storage library to another platform, please get in touch with the
AAF Association (info@aafassociation.org).  Below is the list of all
pre-compiled Structured Storage proprietary libraries in the AAF SDK.

    AAFWinSDK/sss-impl/ssrw_c.lib
    AAFi686LinuxSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a
    AAFSparcSolarisSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a
    AAFPPCDarwinSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a
    AAFPPCDarwinSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.dylib

    AAFMipsIrixSDK/MIPSpro/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a
    AAFx86_64LinuxSDK/g++/sss-impl/libSSRW2C.a

As an alternative, the open source libgsf library is also
supported with some limitations - see Known Issues below for details.


Known Issues
------------
- The pre-compiled Structured Storage implementation provided for Irix and
  the MIPSPro 7.3.1 compiler has the following limitations:
    ScaleTest failure for embedded essence streams >2GB in Structured Storage
	files with 4096 byte sectors
  UTF8FileNameTest failure for opening filenames containing international
  characters

- The SDK will fail at runtime when compiled using the MIPSpro 7.4.1
  C++ compiler.  For example, InfoDumper and ComModAAF will abort with:
  Assertion failed:
    _elementType && TypeDefinition::null() != _elementType,
    file AAFObjectModel.cpp, line 2826

- The Microsoft Structured Storage implementation (ole32.dll) (part of the
  MS Windows platform) can fail when reading or writing 512-byte Structured
  Storage AAF files containing a large number of objects. This does not
  occur with the pre-compiled Structured Storage implementation provided
  with the AAF SDK or the libgsf implementation. The performance and
  scalability of the AAF SDK and a Structured Storage library can be
  evaluated using the ScaleTest scripts.

- The libgsf Structured Storage implementation has the following limitations
  in conjuction with the AAF SDK:
  - No edit-in-place functionality.  This will cause a run-time failure in
    the AAFFileOpenExistingModify() interface call.
  - No RawStorage functionality causing the following interfaces to fail
    - AAFFileOpenNewModifyEx()
    - AAFCreateRawStorageDisk()
    - AAFCreateRawStorageCachedDisk()
    - AAFCreateAAFFileOnRawStorage()
      
  In practice these limitations restrict a client application's use of the SDK
  to only "Import AAF" and "Export AAF" operations using the following APIs:
    - AAFFileOpenExistingRead() (importing from an existing AAF file)
    - AAFFileOpenNewModify() (exporting to a new AAF file)

  To select the libgsf implementation and assuming you have libgsf installed
  under /usr/local, run make as follows
    make LIBGSF_PATH=/usr/local

- The IAAFTypeDefRecord interface implementation does not result in 
  correct property values when calls to SetValue() or
  CreateValueFromValues() are mixed with calls to RegisterMembers().
  This can happen regardless of the order of these calls.  
  In addition, the GetValue() method should not be used following a call
  to RegisterMembers() as it will result in incorrect results.
  If you use RegisterMembers(), confine Record property creation to the use of
  SetStruct() and CreateValueFromStruct() and Record property reading to the
  use of GetStruct().

- There are four divergences between the current SMPTE metadata
  spreadsheet (AAFMetaDict.xls) and AAFMetaDictionary.h. These divergences
  are applied in mkdict.awk as AAFMetaDictionary.h is generated from
  AAFMetaDict.csv. See "mkdict.awk override" comments in AAFMetaDictionary.h.
